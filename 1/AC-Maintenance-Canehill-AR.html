<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have been revealed to trigger the health impacts discussed.

<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>

Indoor houseplants need to not be over-watered because extremely wet soil might promote the development of bacteria which can affect allergic individuals.<p>
