<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
