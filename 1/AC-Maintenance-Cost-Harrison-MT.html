<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
