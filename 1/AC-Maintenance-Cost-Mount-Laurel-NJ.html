<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly reduces direct exposure to contaminants during cooking. Inappropriate change, frequently indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you acquire a new gas stove or range, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot burner that burns continuously. Never utilize a gas range to heat your home. Always ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>
