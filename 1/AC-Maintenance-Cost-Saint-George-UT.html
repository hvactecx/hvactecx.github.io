<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
