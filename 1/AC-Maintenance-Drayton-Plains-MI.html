<h3>Central Heating Systems in Drayton Plains MI</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the issue. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to find an honest AC person and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, considering that it is protected inside. When it does require to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install.
