<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Not Ignore Lavonia GA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in house construction is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in floors, roofs, and walls. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality problems are not limited to homes. In truth, lots of office complex have considerable air contamination sources Some of these buildings might be inadequately aerated.
