<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Usually the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
