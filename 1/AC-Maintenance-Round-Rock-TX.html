These invisible electromagnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a contained system like a house, the warmer items naturally heat the cooler ones up until a balance is accomplished.<p>

The two operations utilize different procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its aims.<p>
