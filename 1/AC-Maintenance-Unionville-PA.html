Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
