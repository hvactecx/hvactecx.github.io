Many standard units break down after just four hours of severe vibration screening, while the Brisk II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel top plate supplies enduring strength while long copper lines minimize vibration and, therefore, sound too. While being among the hardest air conditioners around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, lightweight and capable of performing in any environment! It will not let you down.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow higher airflow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and new air purification innovations are becoming more typical as readily available solutions in residential and commercial HVAC product packages.

<p>Air contaminants can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your family pets to harmful gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air toxin arising from natural gas that leaves into your home without being burned off.

Evaluation of this information might recognize potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs.
