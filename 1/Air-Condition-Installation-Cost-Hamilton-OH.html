<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them till they have been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
