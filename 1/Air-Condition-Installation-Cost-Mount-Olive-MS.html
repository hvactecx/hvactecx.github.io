<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to build business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>
