<h3>The Way to Have the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Troy VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
