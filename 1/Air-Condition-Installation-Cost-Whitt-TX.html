<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
