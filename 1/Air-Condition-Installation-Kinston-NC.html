<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
