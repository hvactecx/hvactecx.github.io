<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
