<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Monkton Maryland</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the see. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your automobile. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter as soon as every 3 months. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
