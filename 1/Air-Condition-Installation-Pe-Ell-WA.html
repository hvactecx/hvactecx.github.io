<p>The homes and composition of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground. These must be taken into consideration prior to selecting the best design of an underground heating & cooling system. Soil with favorable heat transfer homes requires less pipes to achieve the desired underground heating and cooling impact, while those with reduced thermal conductivity will require more pipes.<p>

<p>Some biological impurities activate allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Transmittable diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing contaminants.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
