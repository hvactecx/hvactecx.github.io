Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as merely glowing systems.

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
