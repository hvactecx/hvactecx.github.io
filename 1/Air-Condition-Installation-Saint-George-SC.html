<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
