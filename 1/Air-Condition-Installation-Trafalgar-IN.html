<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy.

Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
