<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
