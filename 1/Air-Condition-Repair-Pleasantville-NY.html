<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Pleasantville NY</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
