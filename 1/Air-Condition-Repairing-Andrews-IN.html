<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
