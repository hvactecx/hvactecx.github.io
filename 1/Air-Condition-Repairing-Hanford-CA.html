They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to order it. My wife said that she had seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good individuals I have met in a very long time.
