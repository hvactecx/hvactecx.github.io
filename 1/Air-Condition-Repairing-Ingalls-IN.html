<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is enabled to rise and stream out high structure openings to the outdoors (stack result ), causing cool outdoors air to be drawn into low building openings.

In humid or warm environments, keeping thermal convenience entirely through natural ventilation might not be possible. A/c systems are utilized, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition areas, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outdoor air when suitable.<p>
