<p>A health survey should be developed and distributed to all concerned workers. Such a tool must determine the number of people impacted; define ages and job descriptions of involved workers; determine where they lie within the office; indicate when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and season); supply a list of specific health signs or illnesses; determine all makers run in the office; suggest the type of outside air contamination; and recognize potential sources of job tension.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
