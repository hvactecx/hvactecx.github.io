According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same pollutants.

If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up.
