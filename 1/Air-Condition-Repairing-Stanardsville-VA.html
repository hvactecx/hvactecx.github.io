<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
