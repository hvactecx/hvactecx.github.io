<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two major parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Some health results might appear soon after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures to a contaminant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are generally short-term and treatable.

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard job that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and ought to not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the choices for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>
