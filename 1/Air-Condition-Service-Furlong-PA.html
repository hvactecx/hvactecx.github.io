<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
