<p>Next, and perhaps simply as crucial when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
