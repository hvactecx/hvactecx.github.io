<p>Instant discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are readily available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Exceptional Customer Care! Environment Pro is trusted and really cared about us and our circumstance. We came home one evening to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could try to find and acquire it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely glad to have a heated house again. What's most incredible was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to assist us right prior to a holiday, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my good friends.<p>

<h3>AC Duct Replacement in Harrison Arkansas</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 major elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>The Way to Maintain Healthy Ductwork To Get A Healthy Home in Harrison AR</h3>
<p>Sean was really handy. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
