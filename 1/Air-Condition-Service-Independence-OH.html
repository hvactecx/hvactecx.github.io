<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is honest, dependable, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to discover an honest AC person and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
