<h3>Repair and Maintenance for New Town ND Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater.

We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
