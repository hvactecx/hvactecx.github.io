<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Secondly like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.

Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
