<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
