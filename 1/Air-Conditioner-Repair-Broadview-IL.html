<p>Many people know that outside air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air pollution can likewise have considerable, harmful effect. EPA research studies of human exposure to air toxins show that indoor levels of pollutants may be two to 5 times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination amongst the leading 5 environmental health threats to the general public.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat circulation over the entire surface area of a floor heats the lower half of the room, enveloping residents in heat at a lower overall temperature-- in some cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heating system."

<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working, stability Energy was fast to react. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the brand-new furnaces can heat the house. Truthfully, our house heating system is complicated, Rob and his team repaired the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
