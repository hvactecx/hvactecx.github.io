<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Sometimes a temporary indoor air quality problem is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complicated problems-- recognized by consistently inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the three techniques listed below may be proper.<p>
