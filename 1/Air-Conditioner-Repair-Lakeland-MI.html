However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
