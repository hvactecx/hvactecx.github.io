<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Use our helpful HVAC contractor list throughout your HVAC installation to make things easier on you and your furnace repair individual.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
