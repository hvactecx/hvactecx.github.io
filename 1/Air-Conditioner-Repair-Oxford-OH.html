<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being blocked with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down completely.

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
