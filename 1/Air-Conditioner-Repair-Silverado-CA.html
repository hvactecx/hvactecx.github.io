Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in extremely humid environments or in cases where the ac system is large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness.

By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in simply a few minutes, often without any tools needed.
