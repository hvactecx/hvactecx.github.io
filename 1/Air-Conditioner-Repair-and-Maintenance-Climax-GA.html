<h3>Boiler Installation in Climax Georgia</h3>
<p>If your air conditioning unit is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the cost, unless it's an easy problem like debris clogging the condenser unit or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to assess not just the condition of your existing equipment, but likewise the ducts that deliver the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your house. Improving those aspects may increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than installing new equipment.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's since it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed just a couple of years back.<p>

Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. , if it does not, you've provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
