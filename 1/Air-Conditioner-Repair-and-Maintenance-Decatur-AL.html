<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All items in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the radiant heat system has actually been operating for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts which abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>

<h3>Getting Through Central Heating Installation in Decatur AL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
