<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead.

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the exact same).

For instance, people breathe out co2, which in small amounts is not harmful, but may end up being hazardous if high concentrations are enabled to accumulate. Micro-organisms or bacteria might likewise exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they may spread throughout the entire work environment or structure by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
