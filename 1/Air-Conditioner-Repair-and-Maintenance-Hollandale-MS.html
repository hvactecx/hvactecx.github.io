<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When trying to figure out how typically I ought to replace my air conditioning filters, there are numerous things to take into consideration.

After that, you can make a much better best decision on how typically your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less often you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one air conditioning filter require changing more often.<p>
