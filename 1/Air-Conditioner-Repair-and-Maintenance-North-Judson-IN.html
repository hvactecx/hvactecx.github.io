<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually brought on by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which results in an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the primary issue in over half the workplace indoor air investigations it has actually carried out. Examinations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the exact same to be true. These examinations revealed that proper ventilation is necessary in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>
