<p>The icing problem becomes much more serious with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are frequently set up in tandem with a more standard kind of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
