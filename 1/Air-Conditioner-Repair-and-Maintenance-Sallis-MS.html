<p>The function of most building ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building safety at affordable energy costs. Load computing is referred to as the Manual J estimation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for a/c.
