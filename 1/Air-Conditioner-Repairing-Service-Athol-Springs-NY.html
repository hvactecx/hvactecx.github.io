<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in which sudden shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have two major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that often, our nationally representative survey found. Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never clean their humidifier or kitchen area variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
