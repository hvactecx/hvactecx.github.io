<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
