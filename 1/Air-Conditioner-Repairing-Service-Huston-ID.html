<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
