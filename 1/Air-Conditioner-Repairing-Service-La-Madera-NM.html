<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, most Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing. The simplest way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
