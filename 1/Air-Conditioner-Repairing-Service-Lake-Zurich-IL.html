<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in gathering info on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.
