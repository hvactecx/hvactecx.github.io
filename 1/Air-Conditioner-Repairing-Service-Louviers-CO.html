<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
