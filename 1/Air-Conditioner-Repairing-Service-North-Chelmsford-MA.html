<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
