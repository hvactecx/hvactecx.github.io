<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
