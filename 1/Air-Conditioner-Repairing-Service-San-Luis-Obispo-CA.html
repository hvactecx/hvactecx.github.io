<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
