Second of all like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have.
