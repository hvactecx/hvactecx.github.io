<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat.

When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats.

Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
