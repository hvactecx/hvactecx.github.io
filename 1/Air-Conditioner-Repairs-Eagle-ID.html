<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
