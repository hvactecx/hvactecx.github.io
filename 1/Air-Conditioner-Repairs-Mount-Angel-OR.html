<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators prohibited. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to create a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-404a and r-410a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in automobiles, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already widely utilized in residential refrigeration.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the visit. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty.
