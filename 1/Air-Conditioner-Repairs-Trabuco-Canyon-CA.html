<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house.

Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>It is especially crucial to take as many of these steps as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can produce high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint stripping, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or engaging in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.

<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
