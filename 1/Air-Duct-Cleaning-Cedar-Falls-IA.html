<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known truth that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as important as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will typically develop in ductwork, limiting air flow. Since ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem very challenging initially, requiring specialized tools, devices, and know-how. When you choose Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to worry about a thing.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible. It is likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
