<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
