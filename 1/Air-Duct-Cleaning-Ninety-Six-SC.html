<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
