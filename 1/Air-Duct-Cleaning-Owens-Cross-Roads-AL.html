This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running, it may simply require to be cleaned. Whether this is the reason for the issue, it's a great early treatment to try.
