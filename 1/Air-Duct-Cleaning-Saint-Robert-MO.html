<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>For instance, contaminants may collect within the air diffusers and grills, presenting pollutants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air consumption lies near a source of moisture or other outside toxin, it might function as a pathway to carry the pollutants inside.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
