<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>These two forms of radiant floor heat are simple in idea. Nevertheless, both systems have a vast selection of different elements for various applications along with a variety of brand name and specific installation requirements. Among the biggest considerations in picking a specific kind of glowing flooring heat is whether the application is in new building and construction or if it's being installed in a renovation.<p>
