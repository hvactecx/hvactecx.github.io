<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
