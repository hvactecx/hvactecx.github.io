<h3>Installation of HVAC in Mentor Ohio</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.
