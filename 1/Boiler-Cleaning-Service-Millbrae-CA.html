<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was type of odd being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and takes time to use. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved issues. I would recommend this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
