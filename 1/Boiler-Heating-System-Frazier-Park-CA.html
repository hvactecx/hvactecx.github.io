<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
