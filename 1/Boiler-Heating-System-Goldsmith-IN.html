<p>There are two primary types of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating business. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are forced to resist present, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>Most credible HVAC technicians will use free estimates with an in-person service call.

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
