<p>Both need to be kept tidy due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Because it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you know it is in your house. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes moderate impacts that are frequently mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms consist of headaches, lightheadedness, tiredness, disorientation and queasiness. The results of CO exposure can differ greatly from person to individual depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
