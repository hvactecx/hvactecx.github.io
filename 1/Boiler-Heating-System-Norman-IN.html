<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and difficulty in breathing in some humans exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common method of decreasing exposure to indoor air contaminants, also will minimize but not get rid of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Due to the fact that cigarette smoking produces such large amounts of pollutants, mechanical or natural ventilation strategies do not remove them from the air in your house as rapidly as they build up. In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it requires to considerably minimize exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses significantly. As a result, the most efficient method to lower exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the house is to get rid of cigarette smoking there.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
