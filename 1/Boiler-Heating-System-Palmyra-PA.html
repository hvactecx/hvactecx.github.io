PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While room air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more costly than central air.<p>
