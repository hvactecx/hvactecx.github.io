<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
