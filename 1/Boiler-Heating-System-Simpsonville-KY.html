<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
