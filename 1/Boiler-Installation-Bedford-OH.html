<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and therefore requires conditions appropriate for both organisms. The germs forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Remediation for Legionella outbreaks in commercial buildings differ, but typically include extremely warm water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in many cases flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive procedures consist of adjusting typical hot water levels to allow for 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, evaluating center design layout, removing faucet aerators, and regular screening in suspect locations.<p>
<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Experts advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller particles and generally are better suited for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
