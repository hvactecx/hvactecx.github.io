<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room.
