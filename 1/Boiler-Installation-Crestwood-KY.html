<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Crestwood KY?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his examination, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Central air systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>I am really satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years ago and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
