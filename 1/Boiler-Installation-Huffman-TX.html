<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your a/c is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leaks, merely including refrigerant is not a service. A trained technician must fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the efficiency and performance of your a/c is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electrical power, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private spaces.

More recent gas boilers need to achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to offer thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold development and wetness indoors is related to a greater occurrence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>

If it blows once again, call a pro-- you've got more severe issues.<p>
