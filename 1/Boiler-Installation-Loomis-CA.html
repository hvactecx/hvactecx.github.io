I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
