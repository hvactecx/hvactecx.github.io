<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a large seller who asked not to be named because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that consistently monitors energy usage and temperature levels in shops to save money on costs (particularly during the night) and to alert shop managers if temperature levels in the shops change beyond an appropriate variety that could prevent customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might observe musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak to your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
