Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
