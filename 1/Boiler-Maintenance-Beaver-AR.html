<p>A geothermal heater is more trusted than options, and is not impacted by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power counts on regular sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the sun nor the wind, however instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and trusted  source of energy.<p>

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Beaver AR</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
