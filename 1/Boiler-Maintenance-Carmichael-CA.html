<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's potentially expensive to install, especially in an older home. Depending upon the kind of system installed, it can be noisy and cause problems if you're extremely adverse dust. In addition, specific fuels and devices might need unique licenses, and there is limited flexibility in the event of altered heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They met my needs entirely by supplying a professional quote with options, without pressing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise quickly followed up with the needed assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>For most indoor air quality problems in the home, source control is the most efficient option. This area takes a source-by-source take a look at the most common indoor air pollutants, their potential health impacts, and methods to lower levels in the home. (For a summary of the points made in this area, see the area entitled "Recommendation Guide to Major Indoor Air Pollutants in the Home.")
