The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
