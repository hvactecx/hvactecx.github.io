<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards usually amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial cost of a system competitive with standard devices.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. Nevertheless, new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>
