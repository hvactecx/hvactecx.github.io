Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP).

And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset.

<p>They were terrific! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my needs completely by providing a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The also quickly followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years ago and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
