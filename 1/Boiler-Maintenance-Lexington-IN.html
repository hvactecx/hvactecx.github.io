<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Manufacturing integrates quality items and exceptional service with innovation and technological advances to provide high-performance heating and cooling products worldwide. A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of several spaces with one external system. In the outside unit of this air conditioning system there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting numerous traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor systems located in the space.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Image 6).<p>
