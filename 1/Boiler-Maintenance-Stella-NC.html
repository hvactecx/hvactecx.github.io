<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square video. They use a series of estimations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs needed to heat the space.
