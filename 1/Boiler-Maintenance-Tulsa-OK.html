Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J computation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square footage alone, move to another contractor. Similar to measuring the size of an unit needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the proper size of unit for your house also depends on the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
