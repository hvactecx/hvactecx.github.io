<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>I typically don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
