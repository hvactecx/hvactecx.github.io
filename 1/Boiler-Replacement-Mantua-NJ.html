<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
