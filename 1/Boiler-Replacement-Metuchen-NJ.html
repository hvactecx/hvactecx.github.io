<p>The Texas Departement of State Health Services (DSHS) Indoor Air Quality Branch has established a listing of qualified indoor air experts in Texas The list represents people holding a professional certification associating with indoor air quality from different organizations. Please note that DSHS does NOT license or accredit these individuals as indoor air consultants.

<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The primary indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, kept fuels and paint supplies, and automobile emissions in attached garages. Actions that will lower benzene direct exposure consist of eliminating smoking cigarettes within the house, offering maximum ventilation during painting, and discarding paint supplies and special fuels that will not be utilized right away.<p>
<p>Homeowners might likewise presume that due to the fact that a glowing floor heating system can be seen (and financed) as a home enhancement, its installation will right away raise their home's worth. No proof exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or negatively affects property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Value Report provided by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Improvement Magazine. Perhaps Real estate agents must consider too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heat system may contribute to, or subtract from, any provided asking price. That stated, property buyers wanting to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who absolutely want an in-floor heating system will be willing to pay a premium for a house that features one.<p>
