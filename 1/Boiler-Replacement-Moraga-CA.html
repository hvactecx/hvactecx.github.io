<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to produce a business union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, R-134a and R-410a are, since 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.
