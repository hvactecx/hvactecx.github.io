I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's tough to find an honest AC man and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
