<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and building occupants might be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the kind of gases and particles) from workplace devices, cleaning items, building and construction activities, furnishings and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor toxins. Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise affect how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
