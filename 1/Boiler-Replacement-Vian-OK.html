<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary environmental threat to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust.

<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and harden-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
