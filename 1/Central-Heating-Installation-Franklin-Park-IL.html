<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
