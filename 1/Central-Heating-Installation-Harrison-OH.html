<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any air flow limitation will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>

<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
