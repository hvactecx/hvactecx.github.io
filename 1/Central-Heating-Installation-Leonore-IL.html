<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a range of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually identified building products, furnishings, and mold as major concerns, but much of the danger likewise comes from burning things. For instance, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop pollution in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly huge problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>A third way to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, look for signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can show your house might not have enough ventilation include wetness condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or smelly air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To spot smells in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
