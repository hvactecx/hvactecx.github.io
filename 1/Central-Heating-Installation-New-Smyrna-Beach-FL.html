<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature. Heating systems that kick on frequently might be because of a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
