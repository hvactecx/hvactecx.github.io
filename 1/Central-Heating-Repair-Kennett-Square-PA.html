When you do see your furnace acting strangely, it is very important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible.

You may also be tracking in lead from soil around your house. Soil extremely near to houses might be polluted from lead paint on the outside of the structure. Soil by highways and roads might be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet prior to going into the house. If you work with lead in your job or a pastime, alter your clothing before you go home and clean these clothes separately. Motivate your kids to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which sticks to fingers and toys. Try to keep your kids from consuming dirt, and make sure they clean their hands when they come inside.<p>
