The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power should not exceed the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, given that the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit.
