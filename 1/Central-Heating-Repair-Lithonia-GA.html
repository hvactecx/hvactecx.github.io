<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has actually ended up being an essential concern to homeowners and health experts.

<p>The compressor can get too hot and shut down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Shut off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2).
