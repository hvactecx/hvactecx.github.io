<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>

<p>Today's home radiant heat systems make the most of infrared radiation. Without a doubt, the most typical source of a radiator in a house is the flooring mass. Radiators can be locally located in one location like a restroom floor or be installed across the whole sub-surface of the home's floorings. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are almost always used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
