<p>Asthmatic kids are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might cause countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke causes eye, nose, and throat inflammation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest pain.
