<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
