<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
