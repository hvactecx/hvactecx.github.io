<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire.

Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan.

To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
