All circuitry for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>We look at ideas before we offer advice to replace rather than repair a heating system. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently.
