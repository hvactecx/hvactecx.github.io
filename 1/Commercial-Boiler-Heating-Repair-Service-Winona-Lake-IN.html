<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
