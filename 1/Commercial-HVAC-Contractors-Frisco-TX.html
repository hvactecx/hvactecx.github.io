<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
