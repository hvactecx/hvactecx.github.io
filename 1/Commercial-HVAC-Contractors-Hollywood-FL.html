All the damp hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then gotten rid of from the space that is being cooled.

There are several locations an obstruction can take place. One of the primary areas where obstructions begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter.

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
