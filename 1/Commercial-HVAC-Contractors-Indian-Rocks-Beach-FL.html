<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material with time.
