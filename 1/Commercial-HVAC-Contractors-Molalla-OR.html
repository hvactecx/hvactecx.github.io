<p>These guys have been great. At a real estate agent, I often require contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a house may cost. Recently I required to call on these men two times. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Stability isn't simply their name, it's an organisation model they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>
<p>Nick B. provided remarkable, individualized, attentive, and quality service. His communication style gets along, appealing and effective. He clearly and completely described all issues and repairs in a manner that made me positive in his ability to resolve my repair problems. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my spouse and I would not need to sustain another night without heat, during one of the coldest winter seasons in recent memory. He also responded to my call instantly the next morning, and coached me through a temporary repair to a problem that could not be resolved on the very first see due to not available parts. I rely on Nick's abilities, experience and ability to provide constant, quality service.<p>
