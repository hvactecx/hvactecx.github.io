<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
