<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
