<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a effective and simple method to lower ambient air pollution and prospective health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>The primary health effect connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
