<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Manitou Springs CO</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes far more severe with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are frequently set up in tandem with a more conventional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump throughout harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
