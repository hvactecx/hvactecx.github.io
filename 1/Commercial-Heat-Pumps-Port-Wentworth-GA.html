Numerous typical building products used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation.
