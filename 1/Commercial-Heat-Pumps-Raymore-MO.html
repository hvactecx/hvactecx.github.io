<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay items. Since they just partly remove the radon decay products and do not lessen the amount of radon entering the house, the effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a trusted means of minimizing the health risk from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further information on air-cleaning gadgets to minimize indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Though it might be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside.
