<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas.

When radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and buildings build up indoors, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>
<h3>AC Service in Verplanck New York</h3>
<p>Home convenience is an essential subject for many people, and it's never more noticeable than if your furnace stops working on a cold winter night.

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the very same way as a car radiator or typical household ac system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>
