The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
