<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, steps must also be required to reduce pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, residents should be alert to the introduction of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization steps should not be undertaken till these issues have actually been fixed.<p>

The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
