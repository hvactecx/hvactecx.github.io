<p>Measurement treatments are being established and shown to assess structure ventilation and indoor toxin concentrations. These procedures vary from advanced tracer gas methods used predominantly in constructing research study efforts to less involved treatments that can be employed by constructing operators. NIST scientists are continually establishing new test treatments, and then demonstrating them in the field to assess their feasibility and reliability. The efforts in which these procedures are demonstrated in the field has actually resulted in the development of an important database of building ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>

Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
