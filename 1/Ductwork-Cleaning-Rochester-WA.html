<p>Oil furnaces are usually not very efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not accomplish a performance greater than 90%.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
