<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
