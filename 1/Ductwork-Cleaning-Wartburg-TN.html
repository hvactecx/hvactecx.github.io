Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
