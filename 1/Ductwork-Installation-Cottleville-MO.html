<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
