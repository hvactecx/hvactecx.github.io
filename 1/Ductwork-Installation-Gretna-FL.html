<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC experts like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that include owning a high-demand, seasonal business. A carefully crafted service prepare for an HVAC company is the first step to manage those peaks and lulls so your profits remain healthy year-round.
