<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
