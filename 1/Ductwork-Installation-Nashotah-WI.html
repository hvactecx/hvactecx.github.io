We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we dealt with concerns. I would advise this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time.
