This might be through a public offering, a sale to a large company in the field, and even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
