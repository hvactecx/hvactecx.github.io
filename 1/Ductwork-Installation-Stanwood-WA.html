When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<h3>AC Duct Repair in Stanwood WA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hr and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely comprehensive in describing what services would be performed.
