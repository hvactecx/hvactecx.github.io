<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne toxins flowing through your system. They can likewise keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
