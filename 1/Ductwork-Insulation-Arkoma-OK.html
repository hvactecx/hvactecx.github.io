<p>Heaters resemble cars and trucks. As they age, you can change one part only require another part replaced or repaired next year. It does not take long to invest $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heaters sustain the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair sign is whether you had to wait to get parts changed. As a furnace ages, it gets harder to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be really cold on a below no night.<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your employer needs to check measurements of humidity, air and temperature level flow.

A structure walk-through to look for odors and search for water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings may be valuable. Leakages require to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being polluted with germs or fungis and need to be eliminated, likewise.
