<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and treat-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
