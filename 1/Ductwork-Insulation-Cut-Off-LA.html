<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can afford, numerous Seattleites need to find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
