<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
