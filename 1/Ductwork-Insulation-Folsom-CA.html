This is usually used in a third-floor or second area and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
