<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
