<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
