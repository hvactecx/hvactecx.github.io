<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Miami IN</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing might be induced as the result of temperature extremes, improper humidity levels, and too much or too little air blood circulation. Work environment temperatures must be preserved between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by excessive air flow ought to be avoided.<p>
