<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated performance benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Because they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
