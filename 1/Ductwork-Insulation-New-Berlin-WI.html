<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
