Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
