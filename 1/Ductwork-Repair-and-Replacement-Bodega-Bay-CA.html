<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated performance benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heatpump are terrific for additions due to the fact that they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Since a system is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
