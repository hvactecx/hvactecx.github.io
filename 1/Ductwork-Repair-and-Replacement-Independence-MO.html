<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Independence MO</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
