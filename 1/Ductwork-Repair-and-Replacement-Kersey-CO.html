<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the condenser, evaporator, and compressor are all located in one cabinet, which generally is put on a roofing or on a concrete piece beside your house's foundation.

Air supply and return ducts originate from inside through the home's outside wall or roofing system to connect with the packaged air conditioning system, which is usually located outdoors.

<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the exact same air course. A basic a/c unit transfers heat out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, since all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
