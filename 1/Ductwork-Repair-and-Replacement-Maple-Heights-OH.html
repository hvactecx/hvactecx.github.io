<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
