<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter can exacerbate problems. Stale indoor air and heater can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your home.
