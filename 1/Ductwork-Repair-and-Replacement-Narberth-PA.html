<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
