<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

They know what it means to supply superior craftsmanship, and they get less callbacks from disappointed customers. Supervisors and founders must also stay abreast of developing innovations and market best practices.<p>
