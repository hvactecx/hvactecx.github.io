The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget-friendly. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
