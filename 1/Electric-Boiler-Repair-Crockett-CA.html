<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a efficient and simple approach to lower ambient air contamination and potential health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also might contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis might become stopped up, decreasing air flow quality, distribution, and volume. They also might become locations for molds and bacteria to be and grow distributed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise should be appropriately kept to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
