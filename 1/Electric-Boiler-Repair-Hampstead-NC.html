<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain poisonous compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible for the most part, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores. The main danger of mold development, as it relates to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More major than the majority of allergenic properties is the capability of mold to set off episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a major breathing disease.<p>
