<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
