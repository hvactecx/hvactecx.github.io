<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold might be living in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and a/c system. There are a number of style methods in use today; however, all ground source heat pumps operate with comparable principles. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
