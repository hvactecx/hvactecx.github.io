Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of wetness in the air might be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the room manageable. The controlled temperature level and humidity assisted preserve consistent paper measurements and ink positioning. Later, Carrier's innovation was used to increase efficiency in the workplace, and The Carrier A/c Company of America was formed to meet increasing demand. Gradually, a/c became utilized to enhance convenience in automobiles and houses as well.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
