<p>My oldest son constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did before. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t actually think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is low and itÃ¢ $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
