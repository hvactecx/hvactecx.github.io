<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
