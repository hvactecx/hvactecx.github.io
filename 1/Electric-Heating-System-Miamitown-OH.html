<p>Geographically, some areas pay regularly greater wages for air conditioning tradesmen. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or just a high level of competitors for experienced trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest typical salaries for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>Air pollutants can vary from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air toxin resulting from gas that leaves into your house without being burnt.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
