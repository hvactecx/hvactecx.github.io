<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heatpump operate on electricity and work like a/c unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heater (like a space heating unit) with the very same amount of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
