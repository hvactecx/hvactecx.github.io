<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
