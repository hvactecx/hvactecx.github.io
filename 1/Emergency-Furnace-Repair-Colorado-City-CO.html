<h3>What Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Colorado City CO?</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
