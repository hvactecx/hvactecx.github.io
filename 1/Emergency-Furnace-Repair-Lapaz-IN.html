As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
