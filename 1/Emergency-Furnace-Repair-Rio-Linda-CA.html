<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>They were fantastic! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They satisfied my requirements completely by offering a professional quote with options, without pressing additional products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also quickly followed up with the needed examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
