If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning unit you need based upon experience or on square video alone, transfer to another contractor.

<p>Great Item! Delivery was kind of odd being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.
