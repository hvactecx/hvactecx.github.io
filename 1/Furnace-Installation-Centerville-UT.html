<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality issues. In the absence of such legislation, the "general responsibility clause" applies. This stipulation, typical to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, mentions that a company must offer a safe and healthy  workplace. Therefore, making certain the air is of great quality is the company's responsibility.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was needed and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the professionals thought they just didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
