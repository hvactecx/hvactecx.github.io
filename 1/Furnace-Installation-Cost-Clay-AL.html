<h3>Solar Heating System in Clay Alabama</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of dealing with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for almost ten years and throughout that time, they have actually constantly offered exemplary service.

<p>Similar to most home enhancement projects, the cost of a full central heater can differ widely based upon the size of the house. The majority of heating systems will last between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, homeowner must consider heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace ought to be matched to the size of the home. A small house, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and turn off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
