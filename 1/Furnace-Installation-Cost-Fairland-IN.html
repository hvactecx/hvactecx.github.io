<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not know why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
