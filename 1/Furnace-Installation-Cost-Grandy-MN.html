<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
