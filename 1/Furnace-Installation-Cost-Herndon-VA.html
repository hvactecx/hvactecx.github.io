<h3>Working of a HVAC System in Herndon VA</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
