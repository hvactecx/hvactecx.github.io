<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the possible to adversely affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and really little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must examine and, if necessary, upgrade the building envelope.

<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz.
