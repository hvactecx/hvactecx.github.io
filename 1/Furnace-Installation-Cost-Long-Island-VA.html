<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service at Long Island VA</h3>

These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
