The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step.

The radiators might be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
