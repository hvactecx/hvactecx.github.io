<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season.

<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem.

The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
