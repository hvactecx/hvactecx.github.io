<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
