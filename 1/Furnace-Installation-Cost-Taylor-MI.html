From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>

<p>There are 2 main types of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating company. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are forced to resist current, which then produces heat.<p>
