<p>While toxins frequently found in indoor air are accountable for lots of hazardous impacts, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are required to produce particular illness. People also react really differently to direct exposure to indoor air contaminants. More research is needed to much better understand which health effects take place after exposure to the typical contaminant concentrations found in houses and which happen from the greater concentrations that happen for short time periods.<p>
<p>It is not useful to design a universal standard suitable for all in terms of exposure and health due to the fact that immunity varies considerably from individual to private.
