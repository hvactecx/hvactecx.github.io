<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the go to. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
