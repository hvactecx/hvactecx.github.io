<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
