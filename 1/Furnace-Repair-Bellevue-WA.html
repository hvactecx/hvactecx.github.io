<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
