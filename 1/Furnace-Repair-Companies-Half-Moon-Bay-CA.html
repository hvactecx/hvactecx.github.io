<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
