<h2>How To Hire HVAC Service in Lansing</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace specialists typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>For example, contaminants might collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing contaminants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air intake is located near a source of wetness or other outdoor pollutant, it might work as a path to carry the pollutants inside. Or the ventilation system may not be working as well as it should-- if debris is obstructing the outside air consumption, for example, or the filters are infected or improperly kept.<p>
