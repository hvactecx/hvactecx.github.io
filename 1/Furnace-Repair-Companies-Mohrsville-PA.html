I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Radiant heat offers warmth from the floor up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
