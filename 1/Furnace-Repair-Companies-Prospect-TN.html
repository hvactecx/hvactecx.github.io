<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the system has actually been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
