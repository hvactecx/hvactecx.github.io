When possible; use inside your home only if the location is well ventilated, usage products that consist of methylene chloride outdoors.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They satisfied my requirements completely by offering a professional quote with options, without pushing additional items. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also quickly followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
