<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>There are many things to take into consideration when trying to figure out how typically I should change my air conditioning filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has a distinct DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how frequently your cooling filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better best decision on how typically your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less typically you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one a/c filter need changing more frequently.<p>

Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
