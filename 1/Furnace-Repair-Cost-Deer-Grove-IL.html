<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner need to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
