<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Hopland CA</h3>
<p>Everyone deal with a variety of risks to our health as we set about our daily lives. Driving in vehicles, flying in airplanes, participating in leisure activities, and being exposed to environmental pollutants all position differing degrees of threat. Some dangers are merely inevitable. Some we choose to accept because to do otherwise would restrict our ability to lead our lives the method we desire. And some are threats we might decide to avoid if we had the opportunity to make educated options. Indoor air pollution is one risk that you can do something about.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
