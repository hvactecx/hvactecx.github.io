<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
