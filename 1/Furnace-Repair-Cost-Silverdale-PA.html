<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Contractor in Silverdale</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
