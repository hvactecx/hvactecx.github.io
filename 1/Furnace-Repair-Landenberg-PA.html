<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service at Landenberg PA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We selected getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
