<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
