Other helpful referral products include products from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality experts can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To reduce contaminants, we suggest setting up advanced air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are developed to get rid of the tiniest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sterilization systems also help control bacteria and organic smells. A lot of store-bought filters can not remove these smallest of irritants and do not get rid of bacteria and gases.<p>
<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin.

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
