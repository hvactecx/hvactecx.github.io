<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage. Ductless heatpump are terrific for additions due to the fact that they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be installed.

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing product acquired with your home.
