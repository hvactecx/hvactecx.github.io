<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
