The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
