<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner.

We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
