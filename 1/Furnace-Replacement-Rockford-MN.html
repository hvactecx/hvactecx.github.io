They consist of delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, fetuses, and kids are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults because lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more conscious the destructive results of lead. Children may have higher exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works however the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
