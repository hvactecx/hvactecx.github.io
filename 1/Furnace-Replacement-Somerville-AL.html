<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to supply enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
