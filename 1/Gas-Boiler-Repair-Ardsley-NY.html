<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil change in your vehicle. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter as soon as every 3 months. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
