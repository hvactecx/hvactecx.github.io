We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the same contaminants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Magazine AR Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in house building and construction is to minimize air leak through cracks and other openings in roofings, floors, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor pollutants tire them from the house.<p>

For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
