<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
