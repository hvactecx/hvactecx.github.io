<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home.

Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
