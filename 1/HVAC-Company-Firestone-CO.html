<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>

For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline allergen could induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
