<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
