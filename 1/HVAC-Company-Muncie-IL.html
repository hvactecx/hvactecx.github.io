<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor.

In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
