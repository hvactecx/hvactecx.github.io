<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
