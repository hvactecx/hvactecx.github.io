<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Lots of common building products used prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Generally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation. Elimination of asbestos-containing products is not constantly ideal since the fibers can be spread out into the air during the removal process. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is frequently recommended instead.<p>
