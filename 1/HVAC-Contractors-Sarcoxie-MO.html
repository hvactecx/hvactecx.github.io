<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
