<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step.
