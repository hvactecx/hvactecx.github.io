<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>The probability of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends upon private level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from person to individual. Some people can become sensitized to biological pollutants after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>To start, it's a great concept to consider energy efficiency. By picking a central AC unit that has as high of an efficiency score as possible, you can decrease your carbon footprint and save cash in the long run. Efficiency rankings need to be identified with all systems. While effective systems might cost more, choosing an Energy Star-rated device is a terrific way to delight in additional assurance.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-lived indoor air quality problem is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complex problems-- determined by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods below might be appropriate.<p>
