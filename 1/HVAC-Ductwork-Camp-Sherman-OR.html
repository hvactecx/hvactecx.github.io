<p>A hydronic radiant flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipelines set up under the flooring or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals. It does not count on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
