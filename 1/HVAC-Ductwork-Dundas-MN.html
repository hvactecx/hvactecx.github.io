<p>There are a couple of possibilities to explain short cycling in really cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the very low temperature levels. In some cases, the furnace will simply run harder to keep a warm environment for your house when the weather condition is incredibly cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. Contact one of our professionals if you require clearness on this concern.<p>
<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically greater than many heatpump choices, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the design you acquire.

This implies it can warm up your home to the desired temperature quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new houses are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. Some of these styles include energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (likewise called air-to-air heat exchangers).
