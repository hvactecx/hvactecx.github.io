Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
