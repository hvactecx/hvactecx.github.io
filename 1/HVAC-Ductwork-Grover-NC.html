<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years back and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floorings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
