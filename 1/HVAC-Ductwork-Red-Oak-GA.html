<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
