Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are usually used in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be brought on as the result of temperature extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too much or too little air blood circulation. Work environment temperature levels need to be kept in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts caused by too much air circulation must be avoided.<p>
