<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
