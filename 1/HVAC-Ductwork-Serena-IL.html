<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
