<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
