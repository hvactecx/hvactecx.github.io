The perfect humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

<p>Stability Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new heaters can heat your home. Honestly, our house heating unit is complicated, Rob and his group fixed the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
