Permeable products, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold development and need to be disposed of. In some cases there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in hidden or rarely accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic.

Opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the moisture issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the area using established health department recommendations.<p>
