<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil change in your vehicle. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear.

Throughout high usage months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
