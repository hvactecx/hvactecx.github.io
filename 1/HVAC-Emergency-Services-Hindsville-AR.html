<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your home still heats to the ideal temperature.

Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working effectively, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you need to hire a specialist to examine and repair the unit.<p>
