<p>Geothermal heat pumps are extremely efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a constant temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0.

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
