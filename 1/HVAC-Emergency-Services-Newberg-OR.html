<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
