<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful toxic waste.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
