It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
