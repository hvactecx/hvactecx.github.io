<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
