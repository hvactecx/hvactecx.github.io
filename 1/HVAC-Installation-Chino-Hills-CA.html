After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
