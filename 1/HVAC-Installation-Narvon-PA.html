<h3>Benefits of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Narvon PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
