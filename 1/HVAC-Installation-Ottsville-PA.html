Change the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned due to the fact that the soot develops inside the ducts, lowering their performance gradually. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
