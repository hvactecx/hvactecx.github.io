<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Companies in Riverside</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heat pumps operate on electricity and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like a space heater) with the same quantity of electrical energy. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
