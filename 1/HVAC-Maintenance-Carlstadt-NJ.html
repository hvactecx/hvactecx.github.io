<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
