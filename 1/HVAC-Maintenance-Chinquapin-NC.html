<h3>HVAC Services in Chinquapin NC</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
