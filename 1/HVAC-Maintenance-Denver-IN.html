<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other workplaces is necessary not only for workers' convenience but likewise for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been connected to symptoms like headaches, tiredness, difficulty concentrating, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Also, some specific illness have been linked to particular air contaminants or indoor environments, like asthma with moist indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause immediate signs but can cause cancer after several years.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of people who live in the house. Toxins could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could likewise come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care products. Bacteria and viruses, pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
