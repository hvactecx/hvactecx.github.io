<p>I am an investor, I require to replace 2 heating systems in a 8000square foot home. Some sources, such as constructing materials, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch pollutants basically continuously. Other sources, related to activities like smoking, cleaning, remodeling or doing hobblies release contaminants periodically. Malfunctioning or unvented appliances or poorly used products can launch greater and often dangerous levels of contaminants inside.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
