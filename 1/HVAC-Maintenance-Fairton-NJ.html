Preventive measures include adjusting typical hot water levels to permit 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, examining facility style layout, eliminating faucet aerators, and routine testing in suspect locations.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they utilize air to exchange heat, in the very same method as an automobile radiator or common home a/c does.
