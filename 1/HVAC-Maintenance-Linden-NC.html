<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Many times, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally only offered for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
