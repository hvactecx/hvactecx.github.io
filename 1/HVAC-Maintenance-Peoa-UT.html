<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when purchasing an air conditioning system to ensure it'll fit easily into the window. Likewise, keep fire safety in mind when deciding where to install the air conditioning system: Don't place it in an egress window that works as the only means of escape need to a fire appear.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as essential when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size.
