<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
