<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.)

We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
