<h3>Central Heating Installation in Cary Mississippi</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch.
