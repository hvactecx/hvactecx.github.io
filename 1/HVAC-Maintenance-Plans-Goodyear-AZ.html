Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of replacing or exchanging air in any area to offer high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
