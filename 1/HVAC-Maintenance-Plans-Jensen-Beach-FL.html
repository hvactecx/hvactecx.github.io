<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
