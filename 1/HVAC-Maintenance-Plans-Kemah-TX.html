<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Kemah TX</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the issue. He is honest, dependable, and sensible on rate. It's tough to find an honest AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Your Review This is my third time utilizing All the time. Ilan constantly makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is experienced with these devices).

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
