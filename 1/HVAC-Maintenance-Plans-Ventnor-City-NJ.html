<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was sort of odd being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and requires time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we resolved concerns. I would recommend this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
