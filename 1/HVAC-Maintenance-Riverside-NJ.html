<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to buy it. My partner said that she had actually seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent people I have actually met in a long time.
