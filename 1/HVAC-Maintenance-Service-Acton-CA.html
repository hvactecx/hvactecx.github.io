<p>My eldest boy constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might position risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
