<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
