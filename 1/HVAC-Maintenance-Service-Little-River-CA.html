<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the construction or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants.
