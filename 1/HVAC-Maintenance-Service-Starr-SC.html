<p>Instantaneous discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Exceptional Customer Care! Climate Pro is reputable and truly appreciated us and our situation. We came home one night to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that same night. Although he didn't have actually the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might look for and purchase it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely appreciative to have a heated house once again. What's most remarkable was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
