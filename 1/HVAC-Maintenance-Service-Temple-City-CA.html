<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a portion efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate however a less effective collector.

<p>The first air conditioning unit and refrigerators employed harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could result in deadly mishaps when they leaked.

The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
