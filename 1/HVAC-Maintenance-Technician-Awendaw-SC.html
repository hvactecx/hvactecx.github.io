<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
