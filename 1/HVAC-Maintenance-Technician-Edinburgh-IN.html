<p>Acknowledged as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Manufacturing integrates quality items and exceptional service with innovation and technological advances to deliver high-performance cooling and heating items around the world. A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of numerous spaces with one external system.
