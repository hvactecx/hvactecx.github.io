<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
