<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the goal of owning an organisation was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the exact same in all other locations.<p>
