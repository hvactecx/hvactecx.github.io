<p>A radiator is the part of your vehicle that keeps the engine cool and protects it from extreme heating. To be cool, the radiator needs to remain tidy - constantly. With time, sludge, rust and other solid deposits build up inside your cars and truck's radiator. These make the cooling system become stopped up and less reliable. This in effect harms your vehicle's efficiency. A routine radiator flush suffices to keep the system fit. For this factor, make radiator flushing a part of your regular cars and truck maintenance schedule. For all your radiator flush needs, call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
