Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in concern was a heating, refrigeration and air  conditioning subcontractor that has actually operated at a number of places at Target and other leading retailers.<p>
<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a big retailer who asked not to be named because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps track of energy intake and temperature levels in stores to save money on costs (especially in the evening) and to alert shop managers if temperature levels in the shops fluctuate beyond an acceptable variety that could prevent customers from shopping at the shop.<p>
