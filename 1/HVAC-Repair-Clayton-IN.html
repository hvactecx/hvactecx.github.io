<h3>HVAC Technician Near Me in Clayton IN</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
