<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
