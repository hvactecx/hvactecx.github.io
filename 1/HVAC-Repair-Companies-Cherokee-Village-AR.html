<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to supply enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
