<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution.

When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
