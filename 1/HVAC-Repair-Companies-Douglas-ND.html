<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit.

<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends on numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial impacts. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends upon specific sensitivity, which differs greatly from person to person.

Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
