While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect.
