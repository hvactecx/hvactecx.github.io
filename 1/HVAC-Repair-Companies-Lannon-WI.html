(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
