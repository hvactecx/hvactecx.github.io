<p>We take a look at ideas before we supply suggestions to replace instead of repair a heating system. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater every year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older system.<p>
