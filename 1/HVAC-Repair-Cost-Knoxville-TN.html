<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
