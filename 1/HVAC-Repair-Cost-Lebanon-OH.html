<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Lebanon OH</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
