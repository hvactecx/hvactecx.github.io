<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones got. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality.

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON.

You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
