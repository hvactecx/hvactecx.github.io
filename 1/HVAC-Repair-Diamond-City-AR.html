<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.

<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Diamond City AR</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are incredibly efficient, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a continuous temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact. The majority of ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
