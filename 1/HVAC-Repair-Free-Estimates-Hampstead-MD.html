<h3>Heating And Cooling Systems in Hampstead MD</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
