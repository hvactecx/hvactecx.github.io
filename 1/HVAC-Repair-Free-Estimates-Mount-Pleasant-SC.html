<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
