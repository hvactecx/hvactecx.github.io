<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar concepts.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
