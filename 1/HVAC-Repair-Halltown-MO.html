<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes.
