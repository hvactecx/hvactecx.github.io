A couple of high-end brand names have an efficiency of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more expensive, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000.

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release pollutants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is frequently important to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not offered, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent ought to request that the employer have air monitoring tests performed. Review of this information may identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information might not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
