Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to find an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
