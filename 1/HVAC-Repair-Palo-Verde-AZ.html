<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in efficiency benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heatpump are excellent for additions since they don't require any new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Palo Verde AZ</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
