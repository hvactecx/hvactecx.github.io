If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next step is to thaw your a/c equipment.
