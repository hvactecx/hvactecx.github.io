<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leaks, merely including refrigerant is not a solution. A skilled technician needs to fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant.

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works however your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
