The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified inadequate ventilation as the main problem in more than half the workplace indoor air examinations it has carried out.

These examinations revealed that appropriate ventilation is essential in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
