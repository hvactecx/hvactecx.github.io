<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should look out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
