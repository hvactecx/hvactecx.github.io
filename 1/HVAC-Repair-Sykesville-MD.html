The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power must not exceed the capability of the outdoor system.

Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
