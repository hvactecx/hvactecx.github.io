<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
