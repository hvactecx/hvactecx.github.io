<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
