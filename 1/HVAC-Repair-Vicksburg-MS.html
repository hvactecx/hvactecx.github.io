If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
<p>For example, contaminants might gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing toxins into the environment.
