<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the goal of owning an organisation was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
