The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
