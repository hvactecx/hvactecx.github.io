<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit".

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
