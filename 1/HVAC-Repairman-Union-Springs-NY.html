Pushed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard consists of a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood item and is normally recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
