<p>The bureau jobs 34 percent work development for HVAC service technicians between 2010 and 2020, more than two times the average for all professions. Numerous factors add to this, including the replacement and upgrade of older air conditioning systems to fulfill more stringent environmental policies. The sluggish rebound in residential and industrial building will create a constant circulation of new chances, particularly for professionals who are willing to relocate. New systems are more computerized and advanced, so professionals who have finished formal training programs at a technical or neighborhood college may have a benefit over those who learn on the job.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may become clogged up, lowering air circulation volume, quality, and distribution. They also may end up being places for bacteria and molds to grow and be distributed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also need to be properly preserved to avoid germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems.

High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
