<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need reasonably little attention. But, as with any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is important to keep the system functioning smoothly.

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely practical in gathering details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same. Once the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly cure and solidify-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
