<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
