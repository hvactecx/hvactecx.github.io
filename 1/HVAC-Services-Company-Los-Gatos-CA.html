<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank.

We feel that this new unit will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel.
