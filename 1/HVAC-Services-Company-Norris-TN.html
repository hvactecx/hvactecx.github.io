<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing at Norris TN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow.

Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
