<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as simply radiant systems.

<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing at Norris TN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
