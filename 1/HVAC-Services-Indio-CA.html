<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
