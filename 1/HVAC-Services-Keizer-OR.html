<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are available to devices installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Outstanding Client Service! Environment Pro is reliable and genuinely cared about us and our circumstance. We got back one evening to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have actually the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might search for and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated home once again. What's most incredible was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover somebody to help us right prior to a holiday, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>I have used all the time for 5 plus years now. I have signed an annual maintenance contract which covers two services every year. Ilan has actually been wonderful through all these years.

<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was sort of strange being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets.
