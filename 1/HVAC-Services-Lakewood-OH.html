<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Lakewood OH</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home building and construction is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofs, floors, and walls. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps tire them from the house.<p>
