<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>

<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate.

<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, consider potential results of indoor air pollution.

While a space heating unit is in usage, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
