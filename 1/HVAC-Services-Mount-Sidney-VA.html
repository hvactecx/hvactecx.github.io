<p>Because the 1980s, producers of HVAC devices have been making an effort to make the systems they produce more effective. This was initially driven by increasing energy costs, and has actually more recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological concerns. In addition, improvements to the HVAC system effectiveness can likewise help increase resident health and productivity. 21 In the US, the EPA has actually imposed tighter constraints over the years. There are numerous approaches for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>The most typical type of home heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least costly alternative, but newer systems can be extremely energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems generally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely effective natural gas heaters can achieve AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are usually just available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
