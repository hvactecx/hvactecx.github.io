That's since it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER.

He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years back and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
