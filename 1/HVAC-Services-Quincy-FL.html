<h3>Floor Heating System in Quincy FL</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>

<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment producer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is frequently hard to measure, as one action mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repetitive use of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early degeneration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
