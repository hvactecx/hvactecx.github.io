Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage.

<p>When all the jobs have actually been completed, the last task is to evaluate the system to make sure it cools effectively. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat. This final check may mention faults in the thermostat, which might be as simple as a requirement to replace batteries. A failure to turn on might just involve a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician talks about any problems or concerns and makes recommendations about upgrades where appropriate.<p>
