<h3>The Way to Choose a Specialist HVAC Technician in Burnettsville IN</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very delighted that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to test the a/c before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in autos in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by lots of individuals.<p>
