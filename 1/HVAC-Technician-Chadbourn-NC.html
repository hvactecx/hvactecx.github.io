<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
