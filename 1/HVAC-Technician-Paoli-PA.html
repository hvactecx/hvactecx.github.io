<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was sort of unusual being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we solved problems. I would suggest this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>A specialized air conditioner that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a basic air conditioner in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air path. A basic air conditioner transfers heat out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, because all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is really heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
