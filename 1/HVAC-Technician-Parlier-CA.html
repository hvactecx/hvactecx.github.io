However, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside.
