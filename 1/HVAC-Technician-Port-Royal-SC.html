<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>A/c producers usually make rugged, high quality items. Start by inspecting any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails. Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers.

<p>Great Item! Delivery was type of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we fixed concerns. I would advise this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
