<p>Glowing heater do not utilize ducts, which makes them a fair bit more energy efficient than other systems. They also don't create cold and hot areas.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not use them.. Second of all like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to correctly service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
