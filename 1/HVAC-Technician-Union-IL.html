<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of workers in the area, stale air might likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>Throughout typical furnace operation, dust, dirt, wetness from humidity or condensation, and microbial developments can build up on internal components. Airborne components from regular household products and surfaces can lead to formicary corrosion within your HVAC devices. Left unattended, these issues can cause loss of effectiveness and worse, breakdown of element products and a much shorter furnace life-span With time, essential components like the heat exchanger, burners or blower housing can begin wearing away, leading to decreased efficiency.<p>

The technician cleans all parts, and checks connections to ensure they are safe and secure.

Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is frequently vital to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping track of information is not available, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative need to request that the company have air tracking tests performed. Review of this information might determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
