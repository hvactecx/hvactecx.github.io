<p>While toxin levels from individual sources might not posture a considerable health danger on their own, the majority of houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a major risk from the cumulative results of these sources. Luckily, there are steps that many people can take both to lower the risk from existing sources and to avoid new problems from happening. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to take actions that can lower the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
