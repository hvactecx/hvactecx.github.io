<h3>Heater Repair in Buford GA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>The majority of well and city water does not generally consist of lead. Water usually picks up lead inside the home from family plumbing that is made with lead materials.

Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
