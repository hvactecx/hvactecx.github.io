Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 must be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
