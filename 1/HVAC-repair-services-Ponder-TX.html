<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by only utilizing the services of a certified contractor or a licensed representative from a company or seller to do the installation.

A voided warranty won't do you any great need to the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the start and hire a licensed person with the experience to install the system.<p>
