<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness.

By contrast, changing a furnace and examining filter can normally be done in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
