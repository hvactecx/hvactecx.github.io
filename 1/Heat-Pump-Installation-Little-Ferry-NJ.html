<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them until they have been correctly dried. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
