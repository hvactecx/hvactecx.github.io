<p>Chemical pollutants: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances.

<p>5. Odor good naturally. You might associate that lemony or piney aroma with a tidy kitchen or tidy artificial scents in laundry products and air fresheners release dozens of different chemicals into the air.
