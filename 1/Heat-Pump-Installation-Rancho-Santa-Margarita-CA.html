<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heating system can also be connected to a gadget referred to as a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat produced from the ground source heatpump compressor and utilizes it to heat water. This indicates that this gadget can also offer free hot water for domestic usage in addition to its standard geothermal heating and cooling function.<p>
