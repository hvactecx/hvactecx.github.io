<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, instead of outside or commercial settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It might likewise include the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to specific areas.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
