<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a lot of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
