<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
