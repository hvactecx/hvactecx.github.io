When you do notice your furnace behaving strangely, it is very crucial that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible. The faster you react to issues with your furnace, the easier they are to repair. Waiting to call for repairs will only make the problem worse, and typically more costly.<p>
<p>I'll start with a gas furnace since it's the most typical heating unit in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%.

It's not constantly about picking the design with the highest SEER rating, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can assist.<p>

Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed just a few years back.<p>
