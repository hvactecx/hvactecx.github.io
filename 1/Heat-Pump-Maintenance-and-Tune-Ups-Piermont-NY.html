<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system.

The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
