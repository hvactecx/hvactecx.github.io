<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for several years.

Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
