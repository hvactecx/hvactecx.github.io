<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

Among the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent possibility; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace.
