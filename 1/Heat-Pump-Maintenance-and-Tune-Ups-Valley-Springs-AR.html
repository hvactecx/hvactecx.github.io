<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature.
