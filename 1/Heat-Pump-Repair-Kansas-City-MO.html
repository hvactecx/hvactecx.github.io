<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up.

A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
