<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, many of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses electrical power, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual spaces. All-electric boilers can achieve up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The primary indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, kept fuels and paint supplies, and automobile emissions in connected garages.
