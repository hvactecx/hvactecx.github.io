<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>More common in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electrical power or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish as much as 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Just like most home improvement jobs, the cost of a full central heating system can vary widely based upon the size of the house. Most heaters will last between 15 and twenty years. In choosing a furnace, property owners need to think about heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A little home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and turn off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature level levels.<p>
