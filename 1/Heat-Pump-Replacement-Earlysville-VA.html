<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Earlysville Virginia</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working.

<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Earlysville VA</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically triggered by the absence of appropriate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the workplace indoor air investigations it has performed. Examinations conducted in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the same to be real. These examinations exposed that proper ventilation is necessary in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they identified the issue and fixed very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
