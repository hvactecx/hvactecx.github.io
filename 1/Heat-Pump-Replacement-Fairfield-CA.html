<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last flooring surface. This is normally used in a second or third-floor  area and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
