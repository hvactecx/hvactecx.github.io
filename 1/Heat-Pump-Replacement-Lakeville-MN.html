<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor.

<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
