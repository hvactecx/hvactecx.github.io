<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
