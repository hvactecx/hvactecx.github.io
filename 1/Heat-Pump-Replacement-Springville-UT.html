<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
