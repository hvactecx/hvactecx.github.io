<p>Today's house convected heat systems make the most of infrared radiation. By far, the most common source of a radiator in a home is the flooring mass. Radiators can be locally located in one location like a bathroom floor or be set up throughout the entire sub-surface of the home's floors. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are almost always utilized in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke triggers nose, throat, and eye irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to secondhand smoke with the start of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold.
