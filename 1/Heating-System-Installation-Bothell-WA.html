<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, given that it is protected inside your home. When it does require to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up.

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
