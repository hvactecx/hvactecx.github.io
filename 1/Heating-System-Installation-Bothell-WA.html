<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, given that it is protected inside your home. When it does require to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up.

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
