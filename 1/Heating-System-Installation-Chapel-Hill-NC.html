Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't completion goal.
