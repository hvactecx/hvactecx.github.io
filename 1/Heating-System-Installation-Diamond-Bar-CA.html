<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Diamond Bar CA?</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants discharged by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high inside your home might trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of co2 in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
