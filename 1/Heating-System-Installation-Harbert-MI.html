<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the flooring. All wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
