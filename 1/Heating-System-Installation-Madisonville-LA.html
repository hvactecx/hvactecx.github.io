<p>In 2011, NASA watched for a cooling system to install in their lunar electric rover. They decided they required professional help and spoke with numerous providers. Lastly, after a rigorous selection procedure, the space agency picked Dometic.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your house that perfect temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service strategy which normally includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
