<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries.
