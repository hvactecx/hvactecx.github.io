<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts years, since it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
