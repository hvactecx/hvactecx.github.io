<p>A customized air conditioning system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, given that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
