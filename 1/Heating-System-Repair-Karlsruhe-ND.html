<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperatures sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to offer thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold growth and wetness inside your home is associated with a higher prevalence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
