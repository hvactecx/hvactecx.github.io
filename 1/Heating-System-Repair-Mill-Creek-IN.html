<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can decrease the efficiency of the coils.<p>
