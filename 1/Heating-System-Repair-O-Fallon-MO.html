<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems at O Fallon MO</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really happy that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the a/c unit before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We want we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
