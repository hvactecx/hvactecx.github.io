<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out.

I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective.

<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in Portland IN</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
