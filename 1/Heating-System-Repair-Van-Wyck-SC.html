<p>Don't stress! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply may need 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat requires 24 volts of low voltage provided by your transformer to keep the digital display screen on. If 24 volts isn't obtained, you'll get a blank screen. There are many different reasons your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be discussing why you might be having trouble with your Nest clever thermostat. Check your emergency breakers initially. You should have the right amount of high voltage going to your furnace. If you have the correct 120 volts of power going to the furnace, inspect.
