<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
