<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to supply enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
