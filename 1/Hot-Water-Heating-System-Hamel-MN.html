<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
