In other cases, such modifications discreetly and even significantly alter structures in ways that may be necessary to their own integrity or their effect on structure occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it helpful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, specifically, a few of the techniques used by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to get an improved understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>
