<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
