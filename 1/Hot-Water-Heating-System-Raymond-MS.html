<p>Correct ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same contaminants. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air conditioning unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's ac system are more energy effective than designs made even 5 years back, so it makes monetary sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years old or older. The very best central air conditioning conditioner you can buy today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one purchased in 1975 while delivering the same amount of cooling.<p>

Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed just a couple of years back.<p>
