<p>Terrific Product! Delivery was kind of weird being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets.
