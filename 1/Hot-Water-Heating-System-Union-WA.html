<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the unit has been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
