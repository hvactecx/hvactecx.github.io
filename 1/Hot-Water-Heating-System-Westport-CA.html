<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
