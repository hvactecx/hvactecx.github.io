<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects.
