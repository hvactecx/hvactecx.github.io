<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
