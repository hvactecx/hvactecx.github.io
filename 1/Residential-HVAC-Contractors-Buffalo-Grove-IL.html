<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
