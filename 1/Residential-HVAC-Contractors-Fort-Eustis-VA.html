Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace too.

If it becomes wet, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
