<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
