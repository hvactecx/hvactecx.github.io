Toxins could come from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care products. Infections and bacteria, family pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
