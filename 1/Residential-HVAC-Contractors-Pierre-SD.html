<p>You might update to the greatest performance gear offered and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are just part of the central air conditioning system. The typical home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric.

This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
