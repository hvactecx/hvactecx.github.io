<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
