<p>We contacted Elite A/C on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to assess situation & chose to choose them for the work.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. When they are dealt with in a method that creates dust containing asbestos fibers which can be inhaled, these items provide a threat only. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or interrupted by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become airborne if appropriate controls are not in place. This can lead to the potential for significant health problems.<p>
