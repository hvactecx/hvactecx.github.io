<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to save money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity.

For that reason, this may not be the very best option for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
