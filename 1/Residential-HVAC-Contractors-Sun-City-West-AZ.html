<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, given that the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not easy, since it considers not only the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

I myself was likewise in the service call service many years ago and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running.
