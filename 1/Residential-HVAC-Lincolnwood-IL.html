<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Lincolnwood IL</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math lately, however I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
