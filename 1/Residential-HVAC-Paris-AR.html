<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
