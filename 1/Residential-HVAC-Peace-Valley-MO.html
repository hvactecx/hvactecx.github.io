<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
