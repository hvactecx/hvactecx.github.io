The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the home.<p>
