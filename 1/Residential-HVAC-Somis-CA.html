<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Somis CA?</h3>
<p>MAINTENANCE PREPARES: Your HVAC system is an investment that spends for itself for many years, but only if you secure it to the very best of your capability. Thankfully, this doesn't have to be a chore! We take care of everything when you sign up for a Keefe's maintenance strategy. No matter what make or design of cooling or heating system you own, even if it's a zone control system, you'll get semi-annual inspections, discounted diagnostics, priority service, and remarkable deals on repairs and replacements. Select in between our bronze, silver, platinum, and gold strategies, and we'll provide you with the greatest level of defense and maintenance.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
