<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, many of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same).

<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also an option for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems include not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, given that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually just readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a good way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best choice for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
