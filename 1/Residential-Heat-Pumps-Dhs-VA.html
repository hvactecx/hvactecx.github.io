<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil modification in your automobile. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear.

During high use months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we recommend using our insulation boards.

By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
