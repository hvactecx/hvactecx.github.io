<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak to your medical professional about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
