<h3>Furnace Installation Cost in Kirbyville Missouri</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the go to. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure.

Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire.
