<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has viewed the single-family house installation service entirely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter season utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately three months.
