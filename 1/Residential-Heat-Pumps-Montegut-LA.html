<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
