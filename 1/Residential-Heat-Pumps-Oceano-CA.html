(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
