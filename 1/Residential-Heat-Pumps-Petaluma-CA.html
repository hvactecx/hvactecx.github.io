<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
