According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>A split air conditioner consists of 2 main parts - a compressor situated outside and a within air outlet unit.

<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Berrien Springs MI</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor toxins discharged by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside might cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Both should be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
