<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has viewed the single-family home installation business totally turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
