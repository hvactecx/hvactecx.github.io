<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
