<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, try to find indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can indicate your house might not have enough ventilation consist of wetness condensation on windows or walls, smelly or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To spot smells in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
