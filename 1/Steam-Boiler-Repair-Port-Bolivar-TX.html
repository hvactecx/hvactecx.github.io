<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working, integrity Energy was fast to respond. They showed up the next day and changed two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the brand-new furnaces can heat your house. Honestly, our house heating unit is made complex, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
