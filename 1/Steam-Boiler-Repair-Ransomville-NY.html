<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.

Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
