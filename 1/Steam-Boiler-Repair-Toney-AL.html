Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good opportunity; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on uncommon occasions.<p>
