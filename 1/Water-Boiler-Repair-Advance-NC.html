<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have actually been effectively dried. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
