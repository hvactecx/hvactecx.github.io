In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
