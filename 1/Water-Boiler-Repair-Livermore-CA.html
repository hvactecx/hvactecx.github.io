In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system boost.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
