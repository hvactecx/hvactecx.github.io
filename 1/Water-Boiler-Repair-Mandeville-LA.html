<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the performance and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
