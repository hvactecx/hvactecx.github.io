<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also create particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
