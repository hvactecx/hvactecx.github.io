<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the issue and repaired very quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work till you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
