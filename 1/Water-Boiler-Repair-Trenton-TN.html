<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Contractors in Trenton</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
