<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, many Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next action is to defrost your air conditioning equipment. The simplest method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
