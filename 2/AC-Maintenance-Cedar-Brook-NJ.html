<p>I am an investor, I need to change two heating systems in a 8000square foot house. You can count on us to finish the job right.

<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95).

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
