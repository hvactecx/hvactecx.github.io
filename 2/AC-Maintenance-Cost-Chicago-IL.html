<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).
