<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road. So, make certain to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which generally includes a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
