<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to supply sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
