Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high use months, check the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
