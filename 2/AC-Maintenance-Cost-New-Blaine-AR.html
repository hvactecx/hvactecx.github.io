<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than outdoor or commercial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private areas.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning system and fridges utilized combustible or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
