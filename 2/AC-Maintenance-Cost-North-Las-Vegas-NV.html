<p>The purpose of a lot of structure ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for resident comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing safety at affordable energy costs. Load calculating is described as the Handbook J estimation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based upon experience or on square footage alone, transfer to another contractor. Similar to determining the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, determining the proper size of unit for your house also depends on the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives typically amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial rate of a system competitive with conventional devices.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the best conditions.<p>
