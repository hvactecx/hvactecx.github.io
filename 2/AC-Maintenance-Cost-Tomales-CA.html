Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
