<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Because they don't need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because an unit is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
