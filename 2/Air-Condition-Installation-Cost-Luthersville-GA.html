<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
