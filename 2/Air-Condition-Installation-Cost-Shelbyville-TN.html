The huge majority of these units are mixed-use or multi-family, where cooling is more of a market standard, says Scott Vollmoeller of engineering firm Glumac.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed just a couple of years earlier.<p>

Symptoms of these illness do not show up till several years after exposure started. Many people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed disease from direct exposure to clothing and equipment brought home from task websites.<p>
