<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Stotts City MO</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
