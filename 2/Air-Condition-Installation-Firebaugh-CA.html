<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier.

By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
