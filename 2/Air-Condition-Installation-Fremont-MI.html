<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Do not place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it since it exhausts warm air out the top. Any air flow restriction will decrease the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
