<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, considering that it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up.
