<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, considering that it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up.

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you have to do it often, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
