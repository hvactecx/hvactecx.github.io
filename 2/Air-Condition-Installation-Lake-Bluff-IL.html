<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
