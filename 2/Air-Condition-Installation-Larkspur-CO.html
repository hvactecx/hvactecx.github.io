<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
