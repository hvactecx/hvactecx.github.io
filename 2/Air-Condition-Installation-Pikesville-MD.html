Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
