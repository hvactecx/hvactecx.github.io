<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when buying an air conditioning unit to ensure it'll fit comfortably into the window.
