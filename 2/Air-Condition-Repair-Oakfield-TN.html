<p>A/c producers generally make rugged, high quality products. Begin by checking any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the system cool down for about five minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>

An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear.
