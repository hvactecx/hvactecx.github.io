<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Service in Los Angeles.

They're priced fairly, have managed the one repair I needed well, and are always on-time and professional. Have been through a couple of companies for many years and Wachoff's is certainly the very best I have actually had the opportunity to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been great.<p>

<p>A geothermal desuperheater is beneficial and extremely efficient, especially during the Summer season while the system acts to cool one's home.

The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
