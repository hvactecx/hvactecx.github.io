<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough task that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my realty clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He assisted me problem shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again.

Fortunately is that the one significant disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or exceptionally hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
