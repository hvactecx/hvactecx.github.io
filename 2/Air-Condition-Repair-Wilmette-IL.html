<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Many people are becoming more concerned and mindful about their health and the impact of indoor air quality.

This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
