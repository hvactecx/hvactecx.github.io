<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This enables items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at house over the weekend. Place control includes moving the toxin source far from residents or perhaps moving susceptible occupants.<p>
<p>The payback for a system can range from 2-10 years, while the lifetime of a system can be 18-23 years, nearly double a conventional system.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
