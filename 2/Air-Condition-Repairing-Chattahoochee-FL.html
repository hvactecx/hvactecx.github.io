<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
