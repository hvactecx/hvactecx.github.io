<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling.

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
