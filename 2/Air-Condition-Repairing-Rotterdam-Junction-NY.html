<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, electricity or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual rooms.
