<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<h3>AC Repair Cost in Temple PA</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He assisted me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reliable, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to find a sincere AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
