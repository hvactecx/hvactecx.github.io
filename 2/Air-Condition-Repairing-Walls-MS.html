<p>A third way to choose whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, search for indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your house may not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy.
