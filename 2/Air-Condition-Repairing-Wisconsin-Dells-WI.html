<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the go to. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be utilizing them again.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day.
