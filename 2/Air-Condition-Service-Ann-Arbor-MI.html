<p>Prior to cooling or setting up any brand-new heating system in a home, it is needed to re evaluate and minimize the energy load of the home. A more energy efficient home will not only lower the cost of a new system and utility costs, however it will greatly enhance the convenience of your home. Before we design and install any systems, we set up a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Basic improvements usually include adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can recommend a number of certified home Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for referrals.<p>

<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces at Ann Arbor MI</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
