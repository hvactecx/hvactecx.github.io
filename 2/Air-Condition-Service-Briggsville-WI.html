<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them till they have actually been effectively dried. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
