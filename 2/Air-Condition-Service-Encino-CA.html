(If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
