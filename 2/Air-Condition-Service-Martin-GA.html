<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold may be residing in your house's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe in addition to the performance of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. But many of the important things individuals do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their houses and worsen asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, in addition to all other types of heat pumps, have efficiencies ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE OFFICER. It's a scientific way of identifying how much energy the system moves versus just how much it utilizes. Many geothermal heatpump systems have Police officers of 3.0 to 5.0. This means for every single unit of energy utilized to power the system, three to five systems are provided as heat.<p>
