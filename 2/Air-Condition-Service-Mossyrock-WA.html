<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
