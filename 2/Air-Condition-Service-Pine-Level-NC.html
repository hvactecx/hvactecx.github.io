<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil change in your automobile. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter once every 3 months. During high use months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>If your single stage air conditioning unit isn't old adequate to justify replacement, consider an entire house dehumidifier. By setting up dehumidification devices inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy a few of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, improving indoor air quality and allowing higher comfort at higher temperature levels.<p>
<p>In some cases a momentary indoor air quality problem is produced simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more intricate concerns-- identified by regularly undesirable air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the three techniques below may be proper.<p>
