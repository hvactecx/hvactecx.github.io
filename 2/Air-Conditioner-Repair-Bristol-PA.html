<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is frosty. Likewise, if the air conditioner smells bad, there could be germs buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat away from your home. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning system's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end new one would use.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed simply a few years back.<p>
