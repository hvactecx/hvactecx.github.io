<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.
