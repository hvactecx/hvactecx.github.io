<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>As mentioned above, activating your new under tile flooring heater prematurely, before the mortar has cured, can trigger the grout to break or to not adhere correctly, and might void the service warranty of your mortar item. In some testing, even the tile cracked when the system was run before the substance had cured. And mortar makers might decline guarantee coverage if you do not follow their guidelines.<p>
