A lot of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate.

<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit.

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
