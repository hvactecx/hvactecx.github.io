<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Shannon AL</h3>
<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature level, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
