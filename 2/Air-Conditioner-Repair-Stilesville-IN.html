Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy.

<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
