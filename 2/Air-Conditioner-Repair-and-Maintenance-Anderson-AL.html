<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight versus the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, however for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter can exacerbate problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too cold to toss open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it is very important to be aware of a few of the allergy and respiratory triggers that might be hiding in your environments.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to provide adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
