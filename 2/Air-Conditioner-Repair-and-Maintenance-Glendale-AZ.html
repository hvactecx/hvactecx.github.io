<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years back and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
