From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>

Pressed wood products produced indoor usage include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, human beings exhale co2, which in small quantities is not toxic, but may end up being harmful if high concentrations are enabled to build up. Micro-organisms or bacteria might likewise exist within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the entire workplace or building by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
