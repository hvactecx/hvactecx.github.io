<h3>AC Service in Westlake Village California</h3>
<p>New air conditioners typically vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER score suggests greater energy performance and possibly lower energy costs. A good SEER score for you depends upon your home size, where you live and other elements. Even the minimally permitted SEER rating is going to be much more energy efficient than your present, old a/c. It's not constantly about choosing the design with the highest SEER score, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealership can help.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are managed by numerous thermostats. In water heater the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is very vital to preserving a correct temperature level.<p>
<p>You could upgrade to the greatest efficiency equipment offered and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system. The typical home's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air gets away the system.<p>
