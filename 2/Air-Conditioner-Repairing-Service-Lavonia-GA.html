<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

If you found that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next step is to defrost your air conditioning devices. The easiest method to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
