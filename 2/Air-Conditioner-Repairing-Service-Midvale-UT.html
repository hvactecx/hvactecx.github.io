<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
