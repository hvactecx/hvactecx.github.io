In North America, divided systems are frequently seen in residential applications, but they are gaining appeal in small commercial buildings. The split systems are a great choice for small structures where ductwork is not feasible or where the space conditioning performance is of prime issue. 19 The benefits of ductless a/c systems consist of simple installation, no ductwork, greater zonal control, versatility of control and quiet operation. citation required In space conditioning, the duct losses can account for 30% of energy intake. 20 Making use of minisplit can lead to energy cost savings in area conditioning as there are no losses associated with ducting.<p>

Poorly situated outside air intake vents can also bring in air contaminated with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological pollutants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
