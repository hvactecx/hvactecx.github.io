Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly.
