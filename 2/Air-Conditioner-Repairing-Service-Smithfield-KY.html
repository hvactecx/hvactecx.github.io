<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heaters.

Your existing furnace may not be the perfect size to fit your needs. A lot of older heater are far larger than essential.
