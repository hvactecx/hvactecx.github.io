<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's potentially pricey to set up, particularly in an older house. Depending upon the kind of system set up, it can be loud and cause problems if you're extremely allergic to dust. In addition, specific fuels and devices may need unique authorizations, and there is minimal versatility in the event of changed heating requirements. During use, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating system to the home.<p>

The size of the system figures out the labor hours involved to develop the system. To equip a home with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand name new furnace or more when you consider installation fees upwards of $50 per hour.<p>
