<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
