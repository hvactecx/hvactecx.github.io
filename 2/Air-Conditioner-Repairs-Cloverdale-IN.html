<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
<h3>Electric Heating in Cloverdale Indiana</h3>

<p>Similar to homes, the most crucial aspect influencing indoor air quality is the existence of contaminant sources. Commonly discovered office contaminants and their sources. include ecological tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant building products; formaldehyde from pressed wood items; other organics from constructing products, carpet, and other office home furnishings, cleaning materials and activities, restroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copying machines, and photography and print shops; biological contaminants from unclean ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the very same way as a vehicle radiator or common household ac system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
