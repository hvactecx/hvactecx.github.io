<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We picked getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>You're motivating the growth of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold development and contamination. Naturally, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very practical in gathering info on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
