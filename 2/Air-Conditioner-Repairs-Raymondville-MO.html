<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
