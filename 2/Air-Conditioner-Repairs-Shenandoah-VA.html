<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it might grovel twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed just a few years ago.<p>
