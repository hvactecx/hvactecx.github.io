<p>HVAC systems have moving pasts in compressor s, flow units, and furnaces. These moving parts need to be oiled frequently to reduce friction and the resultant wear and tear. The technicians will thoroughly clean up and get rid of all traces of particles from the moving parts and use the required quantity of lube to control friction. This procedure needs to be repeated typically to safeguard the HVAC system from excessive damage.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could grovel twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed simply a few years back.<p>
<p>We have been very happy with Stability's equipment (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten completed yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has actually worked extremely well and is so effective that it significantly decreased our energy costs - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we require them for emergencies they responded rapidly and fixed the issue.<p>
