HVAC specialists advise following this basic rule when choosing whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a new system, it's finest to buy brand-new.

As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
