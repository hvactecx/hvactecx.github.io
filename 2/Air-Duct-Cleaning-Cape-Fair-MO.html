<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Cape Fair MO</h3>

It takes very little time to heat up or cool off the house which is one of the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had before.

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
