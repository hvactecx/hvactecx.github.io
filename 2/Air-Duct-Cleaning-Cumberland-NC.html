<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is frequently important to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can in some cases be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking information from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this data may identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
