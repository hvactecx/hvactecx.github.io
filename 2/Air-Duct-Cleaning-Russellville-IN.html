Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is generally greater than numerous heat pump options, they can still be extremely efficient, depending upon the model you purchase. One of the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating choices.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
