The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
