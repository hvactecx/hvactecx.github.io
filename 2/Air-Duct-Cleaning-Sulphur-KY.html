<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95).

<h3>Air Conditioner Parts in Sulphur KY</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
