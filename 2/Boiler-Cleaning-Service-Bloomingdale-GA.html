<h3>Frequent Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Bloomingdale GA</h3>
<p>Most people know that outside air pollution can impact their health, however indoor air contamination can also have significant, harmful result. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air contaminants suggest that indoor levels of pollutants might be 2 to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air pollution among the top 5 environmental health risks to the general public.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
