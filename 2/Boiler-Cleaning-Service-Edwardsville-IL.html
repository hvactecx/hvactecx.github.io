<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.
