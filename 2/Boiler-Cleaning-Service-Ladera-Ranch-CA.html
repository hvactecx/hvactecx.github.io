These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP).
