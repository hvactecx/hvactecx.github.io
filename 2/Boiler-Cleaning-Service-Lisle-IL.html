Each space in the house has prospective asthma triggers. Some problems can be repaired rapidly, but others may require more time and work to control or get rid of asthma sets off. Easy-to-fix issues, such as chemical odors and fragrances, contribute to indoor air pollution and have actually been known to asthma signs in delicate people.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues.
