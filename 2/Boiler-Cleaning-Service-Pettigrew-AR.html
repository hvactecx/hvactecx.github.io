It is extremely important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible when you do see your furnace behaving strangely. The faster you respond to problems with your furnace, the easier they are to repair. Waiting to call for repairs will only make the problem worse, and frequently more expensive.<p>

If your system is near, or past, its expected life expectancy, replacement may be the most economical solution.<p>

<p>One of your biggest interest in regard to central air conditioning is most likely your capability to sustain energy effectiveness You do not want to see your utility bill dive hundreds of dollars every month since of your brand-new central air system. The good news is that today's modern air conditioners are a lot more energy efficient than even 10 years ago. In addition, you can take other actions to improve your energy effectiveness.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience periodic periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2).

Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>
<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Finally, make sure the thermostat is working and located effectively.
