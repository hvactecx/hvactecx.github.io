<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leakages, just adding refrigerant is not an option. An experienced technician needs to repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant.
