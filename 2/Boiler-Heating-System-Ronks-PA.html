<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Right Furnace Repair at Ronks PA</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my house and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
