<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit contaminants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold development and must be disposed of. Sometimes there is a moldy smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in concealed or seldom accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the area using established health department suggestions.<p>
