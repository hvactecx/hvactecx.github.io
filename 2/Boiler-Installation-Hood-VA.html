<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was type of unusual being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets.

<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Hood VA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
