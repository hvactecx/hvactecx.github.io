<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>

These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions require.

Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
