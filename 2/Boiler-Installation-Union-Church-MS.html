Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
