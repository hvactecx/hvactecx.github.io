<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
