<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Cressona PA</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons a furnace will run continuously is since something is unclean or clogged up Prior to trying to fix any issue, take time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is great to go, examine the furnace blower for blocking and clean it. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it. Call a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
