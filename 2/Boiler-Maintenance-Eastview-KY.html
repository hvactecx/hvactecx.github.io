<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
