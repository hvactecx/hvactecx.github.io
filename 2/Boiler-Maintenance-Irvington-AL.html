<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
