<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
