<p>Numerous household items launch natural vapors that can trigger unfavorable health results. These results may consist of nose and throat irritation, headaches, dizziness, and nausea.

<p>As with most house improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heating system can differ widely based on the size of the house. Many heating systems will last between 15 and twenty years. In choosing a furnace, property owners need to consider heat output and efficiency.

A small house, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too rapidly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
