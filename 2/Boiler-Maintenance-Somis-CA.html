<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Somis CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years earlier and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
