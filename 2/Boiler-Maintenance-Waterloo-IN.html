<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up just a few years earlier.<p>

Look for the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central systems are about 15% more effective than basic models. New residential central air conditioning conditioner requirements entered into effect on January 1, 2015; see the effectiveness standards for central air conditioners for information, and think about purchasing a system with a greater SEER than the minimum for greater cost savings.<p>
