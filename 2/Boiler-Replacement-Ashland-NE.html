<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely extensive in discussing what services would be performed. Also Camryn provided excellent client service at the end of the appointment by describing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few ideas of some maintenance jobs we might want to have actually carried out in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC unit's size.

Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
