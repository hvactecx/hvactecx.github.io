<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Children, babies, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups since lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead.

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
