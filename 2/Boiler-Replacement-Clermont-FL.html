<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
