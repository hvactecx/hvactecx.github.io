<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
