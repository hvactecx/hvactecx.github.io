<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that they eliminate wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area.

Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
