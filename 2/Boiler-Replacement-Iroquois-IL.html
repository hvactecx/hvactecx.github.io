<p>The ability of organic chemicals to cause health impacts differs significantly, from those that are extremely poisonous, to those with no known health effect. Just like other toxins, the level and nature of the health effect will depend upon lots of aspects including level of exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and breathing tract irritation, headaches, lightheadedness, visual disorders, and memory impairment are among the instant signs that some people have experienced soon after exposure to some organics. At present, not much is understood about what health impacts occur from the levels of organics normally found in houses. Many natural substances are understood to cause cancer in animals; some are presumed of causing, or are known to cause, cancer in people.<p>

<p>First of all, The after hours answering service agent, John, was very polite and professional. Secondly, Gracion W is a timely, educated technician. He was at my home within the time he gave me, repaired the problem while describing the issue then stayed a number of minutes to make sure it was working properly. The problem was repaired in a matter of time that I've never ever seen before while being a homeowner for 10 years. I also suggest one of the Security Plans, which I belong to, if you like to conserve cash. Thank you." Karen P.<p>
