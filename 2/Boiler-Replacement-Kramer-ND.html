<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While space cooling provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
