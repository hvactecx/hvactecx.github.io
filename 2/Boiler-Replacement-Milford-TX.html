The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
