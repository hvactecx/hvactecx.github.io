While contaminants typically found in indoor air can cause numerous damaging effects, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of exposure are needed to produce specific health issue.

<p>The very first air conditioning unit and refrigerators utilized flammable or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
