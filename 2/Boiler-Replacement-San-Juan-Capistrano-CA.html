It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI certification understand that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one component (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>I am really satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years earlier and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Despite the kind of electric radiant flooring heating system, all are factory-built to stay in one piece and not cut, broken or changed. Any disturbance or disruption in the circulation of electrical power makes the system inoperable. This is among the downsides to setting up an electric convected heat system. However, presuming they are set up properly and effectively taken care of, the likelihood of them having issues is little.<p>
