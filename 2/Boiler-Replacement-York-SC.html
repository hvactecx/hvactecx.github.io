<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>For instance, problems develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in adequate amounts of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or positioned in such a method that outside air does not really reach the breathing zone of structure residents. Incorrectly located outside air intake vents can likewise bring in air polluted with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological impurities that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>

This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While room a/c provides maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
