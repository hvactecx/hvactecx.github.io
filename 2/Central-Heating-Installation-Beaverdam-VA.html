<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can end up being blocked with debris that can restrict airflow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's performance.

By contrast, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in just a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
