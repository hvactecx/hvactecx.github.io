<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
