<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he assisted me trouble shoot the issue. He is honest, trustworthy, and reasonable on price. It's tough to discover an honest AC guy and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do.

Also, clean ducts and correct air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still required to have a professional technician check the system regularly.<p>
