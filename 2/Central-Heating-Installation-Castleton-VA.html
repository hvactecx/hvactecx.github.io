<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had actually found the trouble location in looking over the expense. He dealt with the issue in one day, had adjusted the costs to what I thought about fair before he recalled, understood what may have triggered the problem and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not occur once again. I have actually considered All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
