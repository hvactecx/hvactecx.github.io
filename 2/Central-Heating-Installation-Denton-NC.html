<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my request.

Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, considering that it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your house might not have enough ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or stinky air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To spot odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
