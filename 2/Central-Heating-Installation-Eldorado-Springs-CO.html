<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult task that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps guys working. When a sales guy concerns your house he exists to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>

<p>Sean was very handy. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality problems are not limited to homes. In reality, many office buildings have considerable air contamination sources A few of these structures may be inadequately aerated.
