<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from use.

Heaters that kick on frequently may be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
