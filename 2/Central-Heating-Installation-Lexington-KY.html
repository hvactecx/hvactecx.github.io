The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business many years earlier and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract attempts to upsell you every time they concern carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, although it was 6 months prior to the existing one expired. She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
