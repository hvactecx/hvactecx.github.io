<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
