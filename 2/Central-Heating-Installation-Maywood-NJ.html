<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Companies in Maywood</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, as opposed to commercial or outside settings. For example, promoting maintenance services to existing clients during the slow season can help reduce the peak season strain on your tech team, as noted in A/c, Heating and Refrigeration (ACHR) News Technicians can mostly concentrate on responding to calls from brand-new customers, while your established clients stay happy as their HVAC systems hum along well thanks to proactive checkups. The marketing part of your service prepare for an HVAC company must consist of how you'll advertise these kinds of services.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators employed flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>New a/c usually range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER score indicates higher energy efficiency and possibly lower energy costs. A great SEER score for you depends on your home size, where you live and other aspects. Even the minimally allowed SEER ranking is going to be a lot more energy effective than your existing, old air conditioning unit. It's not always about selecting the model with the greatest SEER ranking, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can help.<p>
