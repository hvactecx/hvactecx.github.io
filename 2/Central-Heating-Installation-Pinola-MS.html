<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
