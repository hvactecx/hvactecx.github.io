<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems at Portola Valley CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater.
