<p>All homes require effective ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside workplaces, schools, and other offices is very important not only for workers' convenience however also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been connected to signs like headaches, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some particular diseases have been connected to specific air contaminants or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause immediate symptoms but can result in cancer after many years.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to close down entirely. By contrast, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can normally be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
