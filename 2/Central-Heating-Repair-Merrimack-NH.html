<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the service technicians thought they simply didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
