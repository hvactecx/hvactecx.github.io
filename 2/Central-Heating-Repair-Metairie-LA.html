<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if essential, upgrade the building envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more effective solution to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, in addition to all other kinds of heatpump, have efficiencies rated according to their coefficient of efficiency, or COP.

This means for each system of energy used to power the system, three to five systems are supplied as heat.<p>

Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one action specified the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented.
