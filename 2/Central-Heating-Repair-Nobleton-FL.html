<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
