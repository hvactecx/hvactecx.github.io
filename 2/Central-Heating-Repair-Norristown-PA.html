<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner in Norristown PA</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by utilizing smart innovation. Martin stated the company can develop a dashboard within the building's controls that will supply information on its systems to enable actual time exposure, offering the ability to be preventative instead of reactionary. This service can be supplied to any commercial client, not simply throughout brand-new construction.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
