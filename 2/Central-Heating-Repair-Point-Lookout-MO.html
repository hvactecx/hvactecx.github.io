<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
