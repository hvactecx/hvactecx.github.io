<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system boost. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
