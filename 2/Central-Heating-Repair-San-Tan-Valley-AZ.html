<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw.
