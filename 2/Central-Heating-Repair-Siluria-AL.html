<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, because the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not easy, considering that it considers not just the small power of the systems, however likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed.

When radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures develop indoors, exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
