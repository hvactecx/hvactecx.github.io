<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
