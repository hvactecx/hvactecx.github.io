<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions due to the fact that they don't need any new ductwork to be set up. Since a system is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy.
