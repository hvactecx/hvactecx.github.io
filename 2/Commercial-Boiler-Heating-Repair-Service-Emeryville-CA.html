The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same.

The outcomes can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
