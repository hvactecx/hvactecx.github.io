<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
