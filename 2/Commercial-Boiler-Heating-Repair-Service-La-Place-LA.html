<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in home building and construction is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, floors, and roofs. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor pollutants exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Don't worry! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it just may need 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat needs 24 volts of low voltage supplied by your transformer to keep the digital display on. You'll get a blank screen if 24 volts isn't obtained. There are many different reasons your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be discussing why you may be having difficulty with your Nest smart thermostat. Examine your emergency breakers first. You should have the right amount of high voltage going to your furnace. If you have the proper 120 volts of power going to the furnace, inspect. Often the furnace switch is inadvertently switched off by someone going up in the attic. There is a furnace switch that in some cases goes faulty. It looks like a light switch in the attic. There are many wires in your furnace.<p>
