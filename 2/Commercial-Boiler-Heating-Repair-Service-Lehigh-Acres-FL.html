<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
