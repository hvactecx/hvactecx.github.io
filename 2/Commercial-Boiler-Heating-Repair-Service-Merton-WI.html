<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in place.

Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of recurring usage of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to holes and cracks. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  a really advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
