<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
