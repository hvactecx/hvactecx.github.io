<h3>Blocked Vents Repair in Saint Charles MO</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
