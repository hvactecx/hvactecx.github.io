But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
