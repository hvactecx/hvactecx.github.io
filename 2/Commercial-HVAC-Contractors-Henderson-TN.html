<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler typically take place.

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do.
