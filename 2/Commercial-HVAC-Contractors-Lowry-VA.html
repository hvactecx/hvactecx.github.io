<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps. Exposure to radon ends up being an issue when radon becomes caught in concentrations and buildings construct up indoors.<p>
<h3>Window Air Conditioner in Lowry Virginia</h3>
<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air may also be a problem.<p>
<p>Air flow patterns in building are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts.

<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely delighted that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner.
