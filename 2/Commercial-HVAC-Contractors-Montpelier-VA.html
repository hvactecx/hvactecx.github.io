<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Montpelier VA Home Owners</h3>
<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming indoors. Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors remove pollutants directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
