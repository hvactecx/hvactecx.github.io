<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably simple to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants emitted by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity.

<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly minimizes direct exposure to toxins during cooking. Incorrect change, often shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue.

Never utilize a gas stove to heat your home. When the fireplace is in usage, constantly make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
