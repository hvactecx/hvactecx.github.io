<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Experts recommend utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are more appropriate for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
