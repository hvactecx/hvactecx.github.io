<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your house that best temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service strategy which typically includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
