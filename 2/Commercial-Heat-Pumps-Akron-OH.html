They may suggest that you trim thick trees or bushes to make sure sufficient airflow around the unit.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating unit is more trustworthy than options, and is not impacted by any external aspects, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar power counts on regular sunshine to work effectively.

This makes geothermal heating a readily available and reliable  source of energy.<p>

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
