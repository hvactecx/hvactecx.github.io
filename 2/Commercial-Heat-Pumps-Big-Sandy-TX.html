<p>A customized ac system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air path. A standard a/c unit transfers heat out of the room since its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, because all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is really heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
