There are many ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Prior to it was understood how damaging lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, pipes, and many other items.<p>
