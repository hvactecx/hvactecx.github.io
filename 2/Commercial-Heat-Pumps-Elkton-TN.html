<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often vital to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such details can sometimes be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring information is not offered, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent need to ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests performed. Review of this information may recognize possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
