He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years ago and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
