The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the very same duration.

<p>Energy effectiveness can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by several thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is extremely crucial to maintaining an appropriate temperature level.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works however your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
