<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
