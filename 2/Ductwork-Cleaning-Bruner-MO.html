Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure materials, smoking, home products, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in made products. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a part of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and finish products.<p>
<p>There are many actions a homeowner can take to select items that will prevent indoor air problems from occurring - a couple of them are mentioned here. Initially, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider using solid wood products. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make certain that an efficient moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it becomes damp.<p>
