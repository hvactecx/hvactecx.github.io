<p>There is no simple answer, however lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is most likely a better service. If the current system has not sustained other major repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be recognized and treated, repairing the system can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
