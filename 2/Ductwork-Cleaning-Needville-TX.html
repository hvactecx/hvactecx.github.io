We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We selected getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
