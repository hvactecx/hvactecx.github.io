<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on a number of factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from person to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's performance. Unclean filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, examining and changing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in just a few minutes, typically without any tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
