<h3>The Way to Soundproof a Central Heating System in Brookshire TX</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
