<h3>Everything You Will Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair at Gaston SC</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics recently, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler generally occur. For the most part, the belt is poorly lined up or used and requires replacement. Follow the guidelines above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
