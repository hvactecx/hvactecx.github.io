<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Don't place the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it since it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow restriction will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and filthy. The old coolant will adversely impact the system's efficiency. To make sure the system is working successfully, consider having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
