<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Lilburn GA</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in home building is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofing systems. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as building materials, furnishings, and household items like air fresheners, release contaminants more or less continually. Other sources, associated to activities carried out in the house, release pollutants intermittently. These include smoking cigarettes, making use of unvented or malfunction-ing ranges, furnaces, or space heating systems, the use of solvents in cleaning and pastime activities, the use of paint strippers in refurnishing activities, and making use of cleaning products and pesticides in house cleaning. High pollutant concentrations can stay in the air for long periods after some of these activities.<p>
