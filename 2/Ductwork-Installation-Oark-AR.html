<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
