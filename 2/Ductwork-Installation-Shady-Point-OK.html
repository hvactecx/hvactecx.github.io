<p>Sean was very useful. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit.

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness.
