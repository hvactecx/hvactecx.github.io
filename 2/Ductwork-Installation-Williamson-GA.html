<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
