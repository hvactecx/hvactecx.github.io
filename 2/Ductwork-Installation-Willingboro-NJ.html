<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
