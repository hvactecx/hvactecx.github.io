<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
