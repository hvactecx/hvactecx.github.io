<p>We look at clues before we provide recommendations to replace instead of repair a heater. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
