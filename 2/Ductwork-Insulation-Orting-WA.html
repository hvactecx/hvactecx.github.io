<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold might be living in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide gas, radon, unstable natural substances ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stressor that can cause adverse health conditions.
