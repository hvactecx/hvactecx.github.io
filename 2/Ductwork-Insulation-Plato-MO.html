<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, considering that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
