<p>Chemical contaminants: Volatile organic substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are various, differed, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical substances.

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening.

<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
