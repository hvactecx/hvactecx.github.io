<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space cooling provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
