<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
