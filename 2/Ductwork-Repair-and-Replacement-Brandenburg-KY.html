<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your vehicle. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter once every three months. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>
