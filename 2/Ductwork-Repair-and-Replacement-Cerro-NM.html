<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
