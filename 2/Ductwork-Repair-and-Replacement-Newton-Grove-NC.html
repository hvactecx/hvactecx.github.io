<p>The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether a person responds to a contaminant depends upon private level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from individual to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological pollutants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical contaminants also.<p>
