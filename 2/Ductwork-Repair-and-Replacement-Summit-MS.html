Therefore, for many individuals, the risks to health may be higher due to direct exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve cash over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as conventional air-source systems.
