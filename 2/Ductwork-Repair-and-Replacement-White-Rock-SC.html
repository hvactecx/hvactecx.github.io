<p>As a skilled HVAC expert, we suggest you have your systems inspected and routine maintenance carried out two times each year, as soon as in the Spring (before cooling season) and as soon as in the Fall (prior to heating season).

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's since it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed just a few years back.<p>
