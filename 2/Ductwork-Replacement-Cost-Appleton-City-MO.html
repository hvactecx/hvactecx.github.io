<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
