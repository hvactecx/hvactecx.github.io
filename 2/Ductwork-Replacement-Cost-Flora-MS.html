PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heat pump While room a/c offers maximum versatility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is typically more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
