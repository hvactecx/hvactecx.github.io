<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to purchase it. My other half said that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have satisfied in a long period of time.

Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
