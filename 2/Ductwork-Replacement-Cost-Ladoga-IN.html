When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in gathering details on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day.
