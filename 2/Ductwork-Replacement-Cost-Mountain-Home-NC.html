<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
