Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
