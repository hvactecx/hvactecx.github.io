<p>The main reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services provided. If the system is brand-new and still under a producer's guarantee, the cost might not be worthwhile. Any major repairs must be covered under the producer's warranty. However, some producers need regular maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
