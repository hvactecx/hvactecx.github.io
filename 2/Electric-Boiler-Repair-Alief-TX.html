<p>Sean was very handy. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
