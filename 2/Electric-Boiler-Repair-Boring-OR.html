<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the rate terrific however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a range of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined structure materials, furnishings, and mold as serious issues, but much of the danger likewise comes from burning things.

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
