<p>Using air filters can trap a few of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable Energy area recommends that "Air Filtration should have a Minimum Performance Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to minimize the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils.
