Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
