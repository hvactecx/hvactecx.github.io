<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature level of the flooring. All wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A great location to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's type of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there haven't bothered with it!
