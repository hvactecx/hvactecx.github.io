With this acquisition, Pueblo expanded its abilities, allowing an improved value proposition for a broader set of customers.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
