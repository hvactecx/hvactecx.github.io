Insulation may be a more reliable solution to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
