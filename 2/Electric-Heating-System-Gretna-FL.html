<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Many times, these units include not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those seeking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, since the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are usually just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
