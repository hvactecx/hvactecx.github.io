<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing.

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible.

For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, leading to holes and fractures. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.. an extremely advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
