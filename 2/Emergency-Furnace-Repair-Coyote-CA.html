<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There ought to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
