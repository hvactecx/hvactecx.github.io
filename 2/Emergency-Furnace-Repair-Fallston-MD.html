<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
