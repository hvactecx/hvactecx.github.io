<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, consisting of people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>
