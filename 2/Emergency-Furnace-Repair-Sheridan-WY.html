<p>If your a/c is more than 8 years of ages, repair is probably not worth the expense, unless it's a basic problem like particles obstructing the condenser system or a used fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to assess not simply the condition of your existing devices, but also the ducts that deliver the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your house.
