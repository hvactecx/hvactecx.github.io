<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
