<p>Before you go out and buy an air conditioning unit, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning system?

Too big and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too little and your ac system will not have the ability to cool your home appropriately. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are just a few of the factors that you need to take into account. Each choice can and will substantially affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to neglect any of them.<p>
