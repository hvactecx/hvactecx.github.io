<p>Do not worry! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply might need 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat needs 24 volts of low voltage supplied by your transformer to keep the digital display on. If 24 volts isn't obtained, you'll get a blank screen. There are several reasons why your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be going over why you might be having difficulty with your Nest clever thermostat. Check your emergency breakers initially. You should have the right amount of high voltage going to your furnace. Check if you have the appropriate 120 volts of power going to the furnace. Often the furnace switch is accidentally switched off by someone going up in the attic. There is a furnace switch that in some cases goes defective. It looks like a light switch in the attic. There are numerous wires in your furnace.<p>

<p>Central air systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
