<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
