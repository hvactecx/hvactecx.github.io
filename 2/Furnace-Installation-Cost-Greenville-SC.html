<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the evaporator, condenser, and compressor are all located in one cabinet, which generally is put on a roofing system or on a concrete slab next to your home's foundation. This type of air conditioning unit likewise is used in small commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts come from indoors through the house's exterior wall or roof to get in touch with the packaged a/c unit, which is generally located outdoors.

In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, below.<p>

<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from procedures or items; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those processes include bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
