<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outside metal cabinet consists of the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet consists of the evaporator. In lots of split-system a/c, this indoor cabinet also contains a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump.

<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Huntington IN</h3>

Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
