<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
