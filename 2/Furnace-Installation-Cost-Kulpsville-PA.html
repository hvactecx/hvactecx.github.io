<h3>Finding Greatest HVAC Contractors in Kulpsville PA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by qualified HVAC specialists. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
