The primary danger of mold growth, as it associates with indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More severe than the majority of allergenic residential or commercial properties is the capability of mold to activate episodes in persons that already have asthma, a serious respiratory disease.<p>
