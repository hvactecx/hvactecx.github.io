<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Disease (BRI) describes less frequent (but typically more severe) cases of people becoming ill after remaining in a specific structure at a certain time. In these cases, there is typically a comparable set of clinical signs experienced by the individuals and a clear cause can often be found upon examination. Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI triggered by bacteria which can contaminate a structure's a/c system.<p>
<p>Increasing energy expenses are not the only reason for high costs. Heaters typically lose their efficiency as they age, especially if they have not been effectively preserved. As a result your oil or natural gas furnace may run longer to offer the same amount of heat. This will trigger your energy bills to go up. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies every month could be utilized to help you pay for a brand-new, much more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating expenses with heating expenses from the previous years. It's time to replace your furnace if there is a significant difference.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

If it blows again, call a pro-- you've got more major problems.<p>

While weatherization is underway, however, actions must also be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners should look out to the emergence of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization steps need to not be undertaken until these problems have actually been fixed.<p>
