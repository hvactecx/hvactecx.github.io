<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for distributing cold and hot air throughout your home, offering a comfy climate in every space. However ducts that are not installed correctly or preserved can distribute impurities from one room to another.
