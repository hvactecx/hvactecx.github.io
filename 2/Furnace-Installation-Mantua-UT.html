Contaminants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon going into your home from the ground below. An air pollutant could likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care items.
