<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in performance benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Because they do not need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Since an unit is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
