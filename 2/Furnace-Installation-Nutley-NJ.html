<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
