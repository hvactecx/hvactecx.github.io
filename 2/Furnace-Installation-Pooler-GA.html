<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
