<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Companies in Calabash</h2>

<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Calabash NC</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
