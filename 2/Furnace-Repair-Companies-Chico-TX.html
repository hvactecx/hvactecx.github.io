These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>More typical in fairly older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, gas or electrical power to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific rooms.

Newer gas boilers need to achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
