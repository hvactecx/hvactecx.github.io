<p>Expert heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic rule when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
