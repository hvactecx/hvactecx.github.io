<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% efficiency or much better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be ranked as low as 80% effectiveness, this can imply considerable cost savings in annual heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>

And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies each month could be used to help you pay for a new, far more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating expenses with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a significant distinction, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>
