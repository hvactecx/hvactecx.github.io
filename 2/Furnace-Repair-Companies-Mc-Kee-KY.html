<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leakages, simply including refrigerant is not a solution. An experienced technician should fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and performance of your air conditioning unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>A/c unit manufacturers typically make rugged, high quality items. Begin by checking any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails. Let the system cool off for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers.
