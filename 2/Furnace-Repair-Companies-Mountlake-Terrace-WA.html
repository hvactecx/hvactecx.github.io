<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema.

<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a home heating system, you may try to find a heatpump more geared towards cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or exceptionally hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are typically only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best option for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
