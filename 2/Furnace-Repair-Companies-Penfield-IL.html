<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
