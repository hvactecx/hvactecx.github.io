<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
