The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
