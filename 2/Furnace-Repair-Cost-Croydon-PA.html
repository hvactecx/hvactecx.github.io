<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that feature owning a high-demand, seasonal service. A carefully crafted service plan for an HVAC company is the initial step to manage those peaks and lulls so your earnings stay healthy year-round. If you didn't produce a cooling and heating organisation strategy when you started your company, it's not too late to develop one now, or to give your initial plan an upgrade.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can become clogged with particles that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By contrast, examining and replacing a furnace filter can typically be done in simply a few minutes, often with no tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
