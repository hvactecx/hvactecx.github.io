<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
