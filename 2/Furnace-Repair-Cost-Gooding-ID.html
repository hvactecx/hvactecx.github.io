<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them till they have been effectively dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
