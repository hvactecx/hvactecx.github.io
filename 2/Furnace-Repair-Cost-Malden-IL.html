<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any airflow constraint will lower the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>

If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
