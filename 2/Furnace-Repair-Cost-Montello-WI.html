<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner in Montello WI</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
