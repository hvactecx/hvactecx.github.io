<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may notice undesirable or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse.

However more intricate concerns-- determined by regularly unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 tactics listed below might be appropriate.<p>
