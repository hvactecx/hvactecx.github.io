<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have two major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heater.
