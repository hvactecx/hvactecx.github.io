<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain poisonous compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores. The primary danger of mold growth, as it relates to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall.
