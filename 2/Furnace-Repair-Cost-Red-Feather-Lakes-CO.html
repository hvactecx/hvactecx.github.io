<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>These guys have been terrific. At a realtor, I sometimes need contractors to provide me an opinion for what deal with a home may cost. Recently I needed to contact these people two times. They came out rapidly and provided me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my client most likely would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity.
