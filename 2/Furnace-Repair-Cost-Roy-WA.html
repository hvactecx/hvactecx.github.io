<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals used in the building and construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices ought to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate products of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also create particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
