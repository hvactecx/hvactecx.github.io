When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heater. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
