<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
