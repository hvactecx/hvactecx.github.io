<p>Sean was very helpful. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work.
