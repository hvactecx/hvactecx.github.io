<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new heaters can heat the house. Honestly, our home heating system is complicated, Rob and his group fixed the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heater seems less like a high-end product and more like a requirement. (Besides, warmed floors were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) But prior to you dedicate to what can be a major remodeling project, it's best to ask yourself whether a glowing flooring heater is an appropriate service for your specific house heating requirements.<p>
