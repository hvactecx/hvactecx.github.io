<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.

<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely efficient, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a constant temperature. These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (COP). COP rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect.
