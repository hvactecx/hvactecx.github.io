<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one response stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repetitive use of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature wear and tear, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  an extremely helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
