Opening windows and doors, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors remove pollutants straight from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
