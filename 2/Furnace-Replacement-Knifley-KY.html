<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a referral later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.
