<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This permits items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Area control involves moving the pollutant source away from occupants or perhaps relocating susceptible residents.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Lake Ozark MO</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
