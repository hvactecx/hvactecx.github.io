In the approaching year, homeowners in Westminster will be needed to install greater performance heaters if they are having actually a furnace changed.

<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
