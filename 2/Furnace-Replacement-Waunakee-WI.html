<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
