Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions.

<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is frequently crucial to identifying the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can often be acquired by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the company.

Evaluation of this information might determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of data might not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
