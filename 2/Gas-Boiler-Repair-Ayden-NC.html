<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a efficient and simple technique to reduce ambient air pollution and potential health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>While toxins frequently discovered in indoor air are accountable for lots of hazardous effects, there is significant unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of exposure are needed to produce particular health issue. Individuals also react extremely differently to direct exposure to indoor air toxins. Further research is needed to much better understand which health effects occur after exposure to the average toxin concentrations found in houses and which happen from the higher concentrations that take place for brief amount of times.<p>
