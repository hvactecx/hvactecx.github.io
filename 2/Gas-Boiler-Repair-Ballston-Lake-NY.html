<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Ballston Lake NY</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really happy that someone as skilled as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit before you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to check AC systems even in winter. We want we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
