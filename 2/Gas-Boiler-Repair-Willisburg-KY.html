<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future.

<p>At present, EPA does not advise using air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay items. Due to the fact that they just partly eliminate the radon decay products and do not reduce the quantity of radon entering the house, the effectiveness of these devices is unpredictable. EPA prepares to do extra research study on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a reputable ways of reducing the health threat from radon.

For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early wear and tear, resulting in holes and fractures. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.  an extremely advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
