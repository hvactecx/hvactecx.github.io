<p>Oil heating systems are typically not extremely effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but the majority of do not accomplish an efficiency higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more costly, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation as well since a drain needs to be set up.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
