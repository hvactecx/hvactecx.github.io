<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
