<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up team was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install evaluation outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
