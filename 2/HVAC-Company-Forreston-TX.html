First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, consider using solid wood items. Second of all, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that an effective moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of if it becomes damp.<p>

Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up just a couple of years back.<p>
