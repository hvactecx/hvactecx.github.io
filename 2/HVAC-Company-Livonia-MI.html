<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Livonia MI</h3>
<p>Even more recent heating systems less than 5 years old have been discovered as bad. A lot of house owners are stunned to discover that their 'brand-new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger. Sometimes it is due to poor furnace design, but in most cases, it's from overlook.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
