<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
