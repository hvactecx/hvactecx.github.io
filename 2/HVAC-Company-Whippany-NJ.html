<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Whippany NJ</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

Since they are actually taxed in the summer, since I live in FL it is vital to have a good AC system in your house.<p>
