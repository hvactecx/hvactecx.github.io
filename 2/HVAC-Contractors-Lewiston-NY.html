<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be permitted to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to preserve and understand.<p>
