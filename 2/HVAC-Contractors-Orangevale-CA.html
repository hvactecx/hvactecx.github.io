<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged.
