<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
