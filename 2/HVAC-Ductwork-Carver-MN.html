<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Need to Know in Carver MN</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
