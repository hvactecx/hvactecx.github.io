<p>A matched system is the mix of products that make up your HVAC system. Depending on your area, a matched system can be made up of the following: an a/c and furnace, a heatpump and furnace, a heatpump and air handler, an air conditioning unit and air handler, or an all-in-one packaged" system.

<p>Power resources: Confirm your access to electrical resources. Many older houses have actually restricted ability to add major appliances at the level of a central air conditioner.

<p>A specific a/c that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioning system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is really heated, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
