<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power ought to not surpass the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, considering that the overall capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, considering that it considers not only the small power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

This implies for every single system of energy utilized to power the system, 3 to five units are provided as heat.<p>
