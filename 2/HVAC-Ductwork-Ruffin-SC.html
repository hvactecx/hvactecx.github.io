<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
