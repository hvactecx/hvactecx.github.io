<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost.
