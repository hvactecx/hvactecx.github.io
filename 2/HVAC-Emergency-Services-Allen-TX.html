<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really practical in gathering information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
<p>Filters can get filthy easily, especially if you live in an area that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, bacteria, and tidy the air.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
