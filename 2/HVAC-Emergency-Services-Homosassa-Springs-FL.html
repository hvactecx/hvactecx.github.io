<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals used in the construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also develop particulates and should be vented outside.<p>

The good news is that the one significant disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
