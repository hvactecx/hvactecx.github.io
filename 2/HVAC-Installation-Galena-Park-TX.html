<h3>Home Air Conditioning Installation in Galena Park Texas</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was really happy they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
<p>The compressor can shut and get too hot down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Switch off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work correctly after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.
