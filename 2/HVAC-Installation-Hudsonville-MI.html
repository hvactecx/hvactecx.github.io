<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They met my requirements completely by providing a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing additional items. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also without delay followed up with the needed evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
