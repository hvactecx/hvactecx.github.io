<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms.

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and place of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This enables products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Location control includes moving the contaminant source away from occupants or perhaps relocating vulnerable occupants.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>It is not advised that "routine" occupational exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to identify if the general indoor air quality meets a particular requirement. Occupational exposure limits noted in health and safety policies and the Threshold Limitation Worths ® (TLVs) suggested by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are intended as a guide to prevent health problem or particular impacts (like eye and nose inflammation) in industrial situations. These limits may not be appropriate in workplace settings or for the house.<p>
