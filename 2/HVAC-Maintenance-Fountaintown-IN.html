<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
