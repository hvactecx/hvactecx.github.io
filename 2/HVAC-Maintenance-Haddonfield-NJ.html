<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. As soon as the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
