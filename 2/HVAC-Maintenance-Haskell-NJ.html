<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Filters can get unclean quickly, particularly if you live in a place that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, debris, bacteria, and clean the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you anticipate it to if they're not cleaned and changed frequently.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
