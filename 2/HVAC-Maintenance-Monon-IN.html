<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

The best times of the year to do such a task remain in the months in which houses are not utilizing their heater.

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really helpful in collecting details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.
