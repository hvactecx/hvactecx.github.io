<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Braham MN</h3>
<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are numerous other toxins that can not only dirty up the air, but result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building products contribute to poor air quality, and can likewise trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpeting and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
