Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the beginning. However then recognized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
