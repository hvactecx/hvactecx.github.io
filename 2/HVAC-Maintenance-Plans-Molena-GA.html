When you do see your furnace acting strangely, it is extremely important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible.

<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They consist of delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Children, babies, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the harmful results of lead. Kids might have higher exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<h3>Repair and Care for Molena GA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Sean was very practical. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
