<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
