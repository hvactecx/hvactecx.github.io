They weren't inexpensive however a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part.

<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Palmer TX</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
