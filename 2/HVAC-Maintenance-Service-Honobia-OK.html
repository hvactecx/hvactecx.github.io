If you run your hydronic heater on a high-efficiency boiler at low temperature level, you can increase its life-span. This conserves you much more money in the long run.

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To begin, it's a good concept to think of energy efficiency. By selecting a central AC system that has as high of a performance ranking as possible, you can reduce your carbon footprint and conserve money in the long run. Performance scores need to be labeled with all systems. While effective units may cost more, choosing an Energy Star-rated home appliance is a great way to enjoy extra peace of mind.<p>
