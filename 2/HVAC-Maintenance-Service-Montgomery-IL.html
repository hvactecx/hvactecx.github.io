<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
