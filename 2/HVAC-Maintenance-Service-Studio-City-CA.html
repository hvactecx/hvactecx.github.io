<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Studio City California</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Studio City CA Home</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require.

Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning unit and heat pump must be free of all clogs and debris.

A professional maintenance technician will flush and clean the condensate drain to make sure all excess moisture streams far from the system.<p>
