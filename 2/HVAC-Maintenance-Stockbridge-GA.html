<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
