<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working. The copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The most convenient way to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
