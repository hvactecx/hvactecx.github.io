<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my request.

Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure.

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years earlier and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running.
