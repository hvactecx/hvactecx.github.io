<p>My oldest boy always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system, think about prospective impacts of indoor air contamination.
