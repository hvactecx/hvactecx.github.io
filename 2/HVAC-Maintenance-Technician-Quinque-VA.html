<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure truth that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is just as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will often build up in ductwork, limiting air flow. Since ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem very overwhelming initially, requiring specialized tools, devices, and know-how. When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not need to worry about a thing.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your car. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter when every three months. During high use months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
