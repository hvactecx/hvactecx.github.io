<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>While toxins frequently found in indoor air are responsible for lots of hazardous effects, there is significant unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are necessary to produce specific health problems. Individuals also react really differently to direct exposure to indoor air toxins. Additional research is needed to better understand which health impacts happen after direct exposure to the average pollutant concentrations found in houses and which occur from the higher concentrations that take place for short periods of time.<p>
<p>Because immunity differs significantly from individual to individual, it is not useful to design a universal standard fit for all in terms of direct exposure and health. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services carried out a ten years research study examining more than 7,000 buildings and over 25,000 ecological samples that were collected throughout the United States and abroad. The structure type consisted of both residential and commercial. The majority of samples examined were tested positive for fungis and germs.<p>
