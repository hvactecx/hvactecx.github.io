And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies each month could be used to assist you pay for a brand-new, a lot more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace.

<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor starts but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. If  it does not, you've provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems at Berkeley Heights NJ</h3>
<p>When you require professional heating, air conditioning, or indoor air quality, call Raleigh Heating & Air. Starting in 1992, Raleigh Heating & Air has been serving house owners in the Raleigh Area.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
