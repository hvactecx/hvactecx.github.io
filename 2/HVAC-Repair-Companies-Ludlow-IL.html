<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They include hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, fetuses, and infants are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults because lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Kids might have greater exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
