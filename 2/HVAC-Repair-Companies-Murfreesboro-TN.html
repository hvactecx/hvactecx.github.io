<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. If your air conditioning unit is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leakages, simply including refrigerant is not a service. An experienced technician must fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant.

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter as soon as every three months. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
