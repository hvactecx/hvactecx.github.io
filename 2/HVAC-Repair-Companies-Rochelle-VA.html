<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have been revealed to cause the health effects pointed out. Nevertheless, it is not always true that the results noted take place at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the home. In most cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health results is too minimal to identify the levels at which the listed effects might happen.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
