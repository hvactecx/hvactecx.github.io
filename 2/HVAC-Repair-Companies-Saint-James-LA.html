<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals used in the building or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can likewise create particulates and must be vented outside.<p>

<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an alternative for house owners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, since the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best option for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
