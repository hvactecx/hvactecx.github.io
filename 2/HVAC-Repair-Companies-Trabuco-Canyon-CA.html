<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.
