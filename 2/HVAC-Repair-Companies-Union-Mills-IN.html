<p>If your a/c is more than 8 years old, repair is probably not worth the expenditure, unless it's a basic issue like debris blocking the condenser system or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to assess not simply the condition of your existing equipment, however also the ducts that provide the cool air and the general quality of the insulation in your house. Improving those aspects may increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than installing brand-new machinery.<p>
<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers used different methods. The CMHC research study contacted numerous duct-cleaning services.

While the duct-cleaning market argues both studies have flaws, no other research study has actually challenged the findings. And although the devices and methods used by duct-cleaning companies have actually changed since these research studies were performed, the duct in homes haven't.<p>

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
