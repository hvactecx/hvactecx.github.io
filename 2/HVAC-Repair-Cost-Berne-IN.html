The large bulk of these units are mixed-use or multi-family, where cooling is more of a market standard, says Scott Vollmoeller of engineering company Glumac.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might grovel two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>
