<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
