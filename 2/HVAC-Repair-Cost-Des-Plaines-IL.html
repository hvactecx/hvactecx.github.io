<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
