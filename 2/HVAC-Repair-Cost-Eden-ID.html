<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a efficient and simple approach to decrease ambient air contamination and potential health risks, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit contaminants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are handled in a method that develops dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these items present a danger only. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or disrupted by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being airborne if correct controls are not in place. This can result in the capacity for substantial health problems.<p>
