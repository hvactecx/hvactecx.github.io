<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good location to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification.

<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system likewise may add to indoor air quality problems.

For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
