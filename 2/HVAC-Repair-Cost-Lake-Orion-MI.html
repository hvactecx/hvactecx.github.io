<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Lake Orion MI</h3>
<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming indoors. Most house heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window a/c with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors remove contaminants straight from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>When installing a wall sensor, think about the height at which they need to be placed. Most frequently they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if people mainly remain seated in that particular area. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending on what contaminant you're attempting to track you'll need to position the sensor appropriately. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside buildings are usually near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is much heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>
