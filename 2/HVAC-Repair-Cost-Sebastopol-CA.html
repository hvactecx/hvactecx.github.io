Although he didn't have actually the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could search for and acquire it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely happy to have a heated home once again. What's most fantastic was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly recommend this company to my friends.<p>
