<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in houses through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in concentrations and buildings build up inside, exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>

<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Stanford KY?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Stanford KY</h3>
<p>If you set it too low, you're motivating the development of mold in moist air. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold development and contamination. Of course, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heating systems have multiple control panel. The largest, or only one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control panel need to be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t correctly identified, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
