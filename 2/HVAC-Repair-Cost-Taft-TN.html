<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price great but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

These companies may also need recommendations on which ENERGY STAR devices is the very best matched for the size of a newly constructed house.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an option for homeowners to consider. Often times, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, because the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are generally only offered for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
