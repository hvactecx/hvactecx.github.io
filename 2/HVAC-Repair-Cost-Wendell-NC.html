<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the higher temperatures in some cases utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold development and moisture indoors is associated with a greater prevalence of resident breathing issues.<p>
