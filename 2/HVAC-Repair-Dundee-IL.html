<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>If you wish to save yourself time and money over the long term, having yearly maintenance performed on the furnace is a good concept. During a maintenance visit, the technician will check and clean up all of the working parts of your furnace and repair any small damage that has the potential to cause bigger problems. Your furnace will be tidy and running as efficiently as possible throughout the upcoming winter if you schedule the maintenance visit soon prior to the typical heating season. An efficient system indicates fewer repairs, so you will not need to be as diligent when it pertains to searching for signs of difficulty and the monthly costs will be less. Having regular maintenance on your furnace provides several benefits that you will observe over the course of the whole year.<p>
