<p>Variable speed is the way to go if it's time to update an aging AC. Already preparing to replace an existing air conditioning system?

You'll feel more comfortable throughout the summertime, and your indoor air will be whole lot cleaner. At the minimum, think about a two stage compressor for improved convenience and performance.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also might contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis may become clogged, minimizing air flow distribution, quality, and volume.

<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that often, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
