<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner increase.
