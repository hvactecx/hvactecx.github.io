<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
