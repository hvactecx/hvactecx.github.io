<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Because approximately 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in performance advantage. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions because they do not need any new ductwork to be installed. Since an unit is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

<h3>Hot Water Heating System in El Sobrante CA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
