<p>Particular instant results resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often challenging to identify if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is very important to take notice of the time and place signs happen. If the symptoms fade or go away when a person is away from the location, for example, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some results might be made worse by an inadequate supply of outside air coming inside or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions prevalent indoors.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
