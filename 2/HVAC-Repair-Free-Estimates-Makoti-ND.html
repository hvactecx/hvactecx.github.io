<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from products or processes; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
