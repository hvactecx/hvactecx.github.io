<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Penelope TX</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me problem shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is honest, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to discover an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. An excellent location to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI certification know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one component (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
