<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be changed eventually. As equipment ages, it becomes less efficient. Central air systems and heatpump usually last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last approximately twenty years. If your system is near, or past, its expected life-span, replacement may be the most cost-efficient option.<p>

It does not take long to spend $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heating systems incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

Before choosing whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring just how much air gets away the system.<p>
