<p>Great Item! Delivery was kind of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>We have been incredibly pleased with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system).
