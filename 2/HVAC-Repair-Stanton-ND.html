<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can afford, many Seattleites should find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the reality of a terrible, harsh summertime.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
