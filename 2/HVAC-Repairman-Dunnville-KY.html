<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood products made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor usage include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

<p>Many people are becoming more aware and concerned about their health and the impact of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt consisting of allergens and contaminants can cover the air conditioning ductwork with time. Occasionally it must be removed to revitalize the quality and boost of indoor air and improve the cooling. Beacon Pipes, Seattle, WA cleans the duct physically by removing the particles from the air filter.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable effect on occupants-- outdoors air should be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
