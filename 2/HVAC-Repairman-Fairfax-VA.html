<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals utilized in the construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of products of insufficient combustion.
