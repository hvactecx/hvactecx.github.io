<p>When setting up the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one involved excavation, running hundreds of lawns of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is rather pricey. Setting up a brand-new geothermal heat pump to work with an existing ground loop is far more affordable.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil modification in your vehicle. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter once every three months. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

I very extremely advise the 2 gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and gratitude for a job well done.<p>
<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
