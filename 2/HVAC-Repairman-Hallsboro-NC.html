<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
