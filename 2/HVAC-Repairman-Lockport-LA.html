<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Lots of individuals are ending up being more worried and mindful about their health and the impact of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt including irritants and pollutants can cover the cooling ductwork with time. Sometimes it must be removed to improve and revitalize the quality of indoor air and enhance the cooling.

<p>The steadiness of the market's development does not always translate to the experience of operating an HVAC company.
