<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur gradually due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
