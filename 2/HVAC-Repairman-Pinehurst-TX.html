<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
