Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one reaction mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive usage of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, leading to fractures and holes. , if that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.. a very advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
