<h3>Central Heating Installation Service in Blackstock SC</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really happy that someone as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to check the air conditioner prior to you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
