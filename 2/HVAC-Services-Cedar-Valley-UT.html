<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
