<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
