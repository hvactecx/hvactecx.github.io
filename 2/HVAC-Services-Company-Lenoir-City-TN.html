<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the tools or abilities needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and correct air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
<p>The main factor house owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the quantity of services offered. The cost may not be worthwhile if the system is brand-new and still under a maker's guarantee. Any major repairs must be covered under the manufacturer's warranty. However, some producers need routine maintenance as a regard to the service warranty.<p>
