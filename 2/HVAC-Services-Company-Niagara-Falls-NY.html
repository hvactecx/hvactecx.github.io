<h3>Truth About Niagara Falls NY Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>All of us deal with a variety of risks to our health as we set about our everyday lives. Driving in cars and trucks, flying in planes, participating in leisure activities, and being exposed to toxic wastes all present varying degrees of threat. Some threats are simply inevitable. Some we choose to accept because to do otherwise would restrict our capability to lead our lives the method we want. And some are dangers we may decide to prevent if we had the chance to make educated choices. Indoor air contamination is one threat that you can do something about.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
