<h3>HVAC Repairman Near Me in Springfield LA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
