<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
