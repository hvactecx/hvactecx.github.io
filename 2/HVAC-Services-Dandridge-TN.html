<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
