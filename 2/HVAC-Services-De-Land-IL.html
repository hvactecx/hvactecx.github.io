He knew just what the issue was and repaired it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
