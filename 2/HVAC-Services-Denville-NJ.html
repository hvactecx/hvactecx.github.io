<h3>Residential Heat Pumps in Denville NJ</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
