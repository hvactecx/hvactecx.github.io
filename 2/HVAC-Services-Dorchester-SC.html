<p>Heatpump are a dream become a reality for folks in Seattle. A/c is something that a lot of Seattleites will only use sparingly, however because heatpump can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds!

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit pollutants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
