<p>As an IMPORTANT SERVICES ORGANISATIONS, we stay Readily available and open to assist with any of your plumbing, drain, heating, air conditioning or electrical requirements.

<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, considering that some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
