I more than happy to say that not just did we get the central air going however likewise replaced the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked to from starting to end were extremely expert, polite and the work was very effectively done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was extremely extensive and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn supplied fantastic customer service at the end of the appointment by describing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance jobs we may want to have actually performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>My oldest child always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
