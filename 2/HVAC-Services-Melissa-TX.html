<p>The icing issue becomes far more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heatpump are frequently set up in tandem with a more standard type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be effectively vented and cleaned up from the furnace routinely. Change the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned since the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their efficiency over time. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
