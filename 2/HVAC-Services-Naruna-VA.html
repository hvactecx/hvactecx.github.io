<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
