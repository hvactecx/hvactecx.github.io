Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
