<h3>Furnace Installation in Deep Run North Carolina</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the see. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the new part. I was really delighted they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>

<h3>The Way to Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Deep Run NC</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was essential and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater because the specialists believed they just didn't appear right and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
