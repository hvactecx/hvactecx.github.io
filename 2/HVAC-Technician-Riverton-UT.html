<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Review your records from tracking your service calls, installation sales, service arrangements and other sales, in addition to the profits and profit for each category.
