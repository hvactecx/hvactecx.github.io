<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>The predominant health result related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
