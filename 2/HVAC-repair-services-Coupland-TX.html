<p>All Points Heating offers home air conditioning, air conditioner installation, air conditioning system maintenance that deliver dependable, tested performance at high efficiency. Lastly, the best times of the year to install a central heating unit remain in the spring and summertime. Because of decreased demand in the warmer months, contractors might be offered to perform work earlier and perhaps at lower costs.

<p>I have used all the time for 5 plus years now. I have signed an annual maintenance agreement which covers 2 services every year. Ilan has actually been great through all these years.

Would recommend them anytime.<p>

It produces not just a specific tonnage requirement, however identifies how much cool air each room requires. All bids (get at least 3, from certified, well-regarded companies) should include this one-page hard copy.<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating unit. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperature levels drop and reach below freezing, your heating technician can set up controls which immediately shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>

Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
