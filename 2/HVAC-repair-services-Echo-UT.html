Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
