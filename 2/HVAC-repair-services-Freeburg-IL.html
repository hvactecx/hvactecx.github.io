<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements.
