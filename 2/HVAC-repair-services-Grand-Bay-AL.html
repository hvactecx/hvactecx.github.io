<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outside system.

However, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, considering that the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Put simply, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level.
