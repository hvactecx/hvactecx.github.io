<p>There are two main kinds of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating company. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to withstand present, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
