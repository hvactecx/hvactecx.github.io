<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce toxins.)
