In other cases, such changes subtly and even significantly alter structures in ways that might be very important to their own integrity or their effect on building occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We might find it helpful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, a few of the techniques used by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to acquire a boosted understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>
