<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Sandy Springs South Carolina</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Lots of HVAC company owner do not recognize they need different rates schemes for various services that their company uses. For example, residential HVAC installation must be priced differently from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service ought to be priced in a different way from duct cleaning. If you are offering more than one service, you must separate these into different departments, as if they were their own separate business.<p>
<p>Consider buying an energy-efficient model if your air conditioner is old. Look for the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central systems have to do with 15% more efficient than basic models. New residential central air conditioner standards entered into effect on January 1, 2015; see the efficiency requirements for central air conditioners for details, and think about purchasing a system with a higher SEER than the minimum for greater savings.<p>
