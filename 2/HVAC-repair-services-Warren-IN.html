<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
