<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. Connection problems along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the unit. Loose, missing or defective wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace includes checking the advised connections as well as temperature and pressure determines. Require time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, making certain that they are tight and safe.<p>
