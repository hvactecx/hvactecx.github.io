Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Care Tips in Barberton OH</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We picked getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
