PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While space cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
