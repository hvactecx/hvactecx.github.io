<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>The main reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services provided.
