<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
