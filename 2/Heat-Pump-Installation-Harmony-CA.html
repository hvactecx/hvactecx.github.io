<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
