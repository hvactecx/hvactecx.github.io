<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
