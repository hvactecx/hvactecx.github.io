He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is likewise an alternative for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to save cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, given that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
