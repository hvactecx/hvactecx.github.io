<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Usually the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later in this area.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
