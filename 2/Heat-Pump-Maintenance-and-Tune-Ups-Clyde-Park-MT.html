<p>Usually the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
