<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, considering that some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
