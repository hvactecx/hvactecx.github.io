<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power ought to not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not simple, given that it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
