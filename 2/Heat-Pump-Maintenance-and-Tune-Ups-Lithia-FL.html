<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Many HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that allow homeowner to manage the temperature and set it on a schedule. For example, you can set the thermostat to reduce the heat when you're not in home to conserve cash on the energy bills and guarantee the system isn't overburdened. A professional technician will examine the thermostat during the yearly maintenance to make sure the real temperature and the temperature on the thermostat matches.
