<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
