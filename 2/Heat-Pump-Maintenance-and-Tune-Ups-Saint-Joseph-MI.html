<h3>Commercial Air Conditioner in Saint Joseph MI</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the concern. He is truthful, trusted, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to find a sincere AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this enter the backyards of homes. With split system units, most of the elements are housed in a metal box beyond the house. However, there are some internal components also. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple spaces at the same time, however are not really energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who use this may spend more money on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to change the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the brand-new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor system if you do so. However, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and cooling designs, it may be smarter to replace the entire system.<p>
