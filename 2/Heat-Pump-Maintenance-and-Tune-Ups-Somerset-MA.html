<p>A geothermal heatpump is one of the most energy effective techniques of heating or cooling a house. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and moving energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found simply a couple of feet below ground. In the summer season, the process reverses, thus cooling a home by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature stays constant no matter the climate, so geothermal systems provide constant and trustworthy cooling and heating.<p>
<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heatpump work best in a mild climate, where the temperature level does not get too high or too low. To put it simply, they are perfect for our Seattle environment! They are highly effective, vanquishing most other kinds of heating systems in performance.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
