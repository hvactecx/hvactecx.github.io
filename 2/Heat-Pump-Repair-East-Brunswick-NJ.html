<h3>Baseboard Heaters in East Brunswick NJ</h3>
<p>Remember that the SEER rating is computed using the same set of temperature levels throughout the board. The typical summer temperature level to arrive at the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to get to the appropriate SEER rating for your area, subtract 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score has to be at least 13 for all brand-new air conditioning units made in the United States.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
