<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the unit has actually been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Laurel FL</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ac system service appointments cover a long list of checks in, on and around your equipment.

<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to effectively cool the house on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
