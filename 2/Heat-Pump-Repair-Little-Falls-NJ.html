<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay items. Because they just partially eliminate the radon decay items and do not lessen the quantity of radon going into the home, the effectiveness of these gadgets is unsure.

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, supplies more details on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can manage, many Seattleites should find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a terrible, terrible summer season.<p>
