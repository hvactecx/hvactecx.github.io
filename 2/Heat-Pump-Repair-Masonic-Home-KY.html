<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall.

Ductless heatpump are fantastic for additions because they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Because a system is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
