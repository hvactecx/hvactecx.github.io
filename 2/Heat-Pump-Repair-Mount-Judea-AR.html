Their techs are very well-informed and professional. Costs are sensible. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser this week. I did not trouble to get rival's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff due to the fact that the cost was certainly affordable.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
