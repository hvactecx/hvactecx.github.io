<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to lower the quantity of energy required for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions need to also be required to decrease pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, locals should look out to the emergence of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization procedures must not be undertaken until these issues have been corrected.<p>
