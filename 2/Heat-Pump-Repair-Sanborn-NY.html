<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
