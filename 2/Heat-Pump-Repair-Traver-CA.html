Since of recent warmer summer seasons and for environmental factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue.

A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
