<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
