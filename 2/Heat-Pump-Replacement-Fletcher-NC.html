<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts might appear after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue.
