<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's most likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next action is to thaw your a/c devices. The most convenient method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
