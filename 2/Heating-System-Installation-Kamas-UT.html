A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, see Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
