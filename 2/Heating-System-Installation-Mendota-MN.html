<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, many of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
