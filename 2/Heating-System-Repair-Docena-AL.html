<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
