<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it changed (also Carrier).<p>
