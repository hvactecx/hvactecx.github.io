<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace since it's the most typical heating unit in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
