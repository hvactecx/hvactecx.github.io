<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

You can decrease your costs thanks to local rebates, special deals and tax credits To get the most accurate price for your home, schedule a house evaluation with your local dealer.<p>
