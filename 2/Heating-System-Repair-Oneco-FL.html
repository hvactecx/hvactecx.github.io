<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Make certain all the registers in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it.
