<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
