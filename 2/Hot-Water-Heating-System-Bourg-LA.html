<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure.
