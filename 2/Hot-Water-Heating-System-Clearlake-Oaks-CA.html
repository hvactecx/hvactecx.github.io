<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure reality that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as important as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will often build up in ductwork, restricting air flow.

<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot next to the radiators. This normally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window.

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
