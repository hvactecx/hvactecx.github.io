With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.
