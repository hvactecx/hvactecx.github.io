The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the work environment indoor air investigations it has actually performed. Investigations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the same to be real.

<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
