<h3>Furnace Cleaning in Payneville KY</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
