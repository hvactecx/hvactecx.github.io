<h3>Things Every Homeowner Truth About Selecting Rogers MN HVAC Firms </h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
