<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, lightheadedness, visual conditions, and memory problems are among the instant signs that some people have actually experienced right after direct exposure to some organics. At present, very little is understood about what health impacts take place from the levels of organics typically found in homes.
