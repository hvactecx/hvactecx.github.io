<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the prospective to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if essential, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more effective solution to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
