<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
