<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 ought to be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>

They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months before the existing one ended. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
