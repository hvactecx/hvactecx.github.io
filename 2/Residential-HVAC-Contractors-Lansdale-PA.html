<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern. He is honest, trusted, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to discover an honest AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
