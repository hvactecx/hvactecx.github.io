<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
