<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
