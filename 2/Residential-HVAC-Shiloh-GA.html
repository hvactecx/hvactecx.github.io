<p>Chemical toxins: Volatile natural compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and common. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; floor, furniture and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
