<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be caused as the outcome of temperature level extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and too little or too much air blood circulation.
