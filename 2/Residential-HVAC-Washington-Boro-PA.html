<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
