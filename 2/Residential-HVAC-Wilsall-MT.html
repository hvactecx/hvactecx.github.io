<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
