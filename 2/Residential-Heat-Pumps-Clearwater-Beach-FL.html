<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
