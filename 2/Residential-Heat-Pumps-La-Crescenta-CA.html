The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
