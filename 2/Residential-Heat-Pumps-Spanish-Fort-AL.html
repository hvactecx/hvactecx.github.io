<h3>Heating And Cooling Services in Spanish Fort AL</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit".

When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
