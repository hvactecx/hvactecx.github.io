<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else might come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to order it. My other half stated that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good individuals I have actually met in a long time.

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Ensure all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
