<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was kind of strange being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we dealt with problems. I would suggest this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

So do not just replace it and think you've fixed the problem. Rather, replace the parts we reveal here. Then install new fuses and fire up the system. If it blows once again, call a pro-- you've got more severe problems.<p>
