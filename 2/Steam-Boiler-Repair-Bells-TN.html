<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been effectively dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
