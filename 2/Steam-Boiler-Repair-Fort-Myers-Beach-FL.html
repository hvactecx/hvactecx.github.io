<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them until they have been correctly dried. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for. They satisfied my needs totally by providing an expert quote with options, without pressing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also without delay followed up with the required examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
