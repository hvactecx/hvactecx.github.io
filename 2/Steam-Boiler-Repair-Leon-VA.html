<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm eventually. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big organisation in the field, and even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years before that.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
