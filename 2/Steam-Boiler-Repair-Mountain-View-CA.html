<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace at Mountain View CA</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
