<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
