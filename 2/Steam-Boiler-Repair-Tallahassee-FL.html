<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
