<p>Before cooling or setting up any brand-new heating system in a home, it is essential to re evaluate and minimize the energy load of the house.

Before we style and set up any systems, we arrange a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Basic enhancements normally consist of adding insulation and air sealing measures. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can advise numerous certified home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for references.<p>
