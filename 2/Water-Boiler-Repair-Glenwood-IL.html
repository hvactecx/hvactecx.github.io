<p>Appropriate ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same toxins. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, children, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults because lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Kids may have greater exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
