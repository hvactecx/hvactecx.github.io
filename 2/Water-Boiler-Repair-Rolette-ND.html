<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
