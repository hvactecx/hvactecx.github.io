<h3>How to Maintain Healthy Ductwork To Get A Healthy Home in Ashippun WI</h3>
<p>Many people understand that outside air pollution can affect their health, however indoor air pollution can likewise have considerable, hazardous result. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air toxins show that indoor levels of pollutants may be two to 5 times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air contamination among the top five environmental health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
