<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
