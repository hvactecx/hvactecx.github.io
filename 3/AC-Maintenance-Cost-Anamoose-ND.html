<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
