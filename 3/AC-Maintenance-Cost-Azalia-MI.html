We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
