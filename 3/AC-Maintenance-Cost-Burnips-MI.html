<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the possible to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very little particles of dust.

<p>Oftentimes, if materials have failed to dry several days after the thought water event, mold growth is thought within wall cavities even if it is not immediately visible.
