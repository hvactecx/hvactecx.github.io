<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
