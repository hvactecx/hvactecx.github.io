<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few reasonable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install inspection outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Most well and city water does not generally contain lead. Water normally picks up lead inside the house from household plumbing that is made with lead products. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked, the only method to know. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my requirements totally by supplying a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the essential evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
