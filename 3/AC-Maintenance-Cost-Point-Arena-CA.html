<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might get in close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
