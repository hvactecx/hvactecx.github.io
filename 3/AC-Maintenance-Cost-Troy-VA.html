<h3>Working of a HVAC System in Troy VA</h3>
<p>Elements that can contribute to the development of biological pollutants are damp or moist structure materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and poorly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning system. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Numerous fungi and germs grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these contaminants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the structure residents. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
