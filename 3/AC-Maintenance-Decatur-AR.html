In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger instant signs but can result in cancer after many years.<p>
<p>The EPA advises that you have your duct checked by an expert heating and cooling contractor. If your technician discovers that your air ducts have considerable mold, dust, dirt, and other contaminants or a moldy smell, they may advise duct cleaning This is especially essential if somebody in your household has asthma, allergies, or other symptoms that may be connected to indoor air contamination.<p>
