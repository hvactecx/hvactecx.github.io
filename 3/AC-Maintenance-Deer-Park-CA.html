<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a big seller who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps an eye on energy usage and temperature levels in shops to save money on costs (particularly at night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores fluctuate beyond an appropriate range that might prevent clients from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may notice unpleasant or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
