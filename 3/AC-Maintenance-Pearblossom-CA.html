<h3>Ductless Heat Pump in Pearblossom California</h3>
<p>When central air conditioning service stops working during a heat spell, you may need to wait days for an HVAC repair technician or an ac contractor to show up, and you'll most likely pay a minimum of several hundred for the repair.

A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter as soon as every three months. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
