I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

All of the current furnaces are much more energy-efficient than those set up even twenty years back.

<p>They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites should discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are taken up as soon as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a harsh, vicious summertime.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to provide adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
