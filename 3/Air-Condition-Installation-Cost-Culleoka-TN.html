(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
