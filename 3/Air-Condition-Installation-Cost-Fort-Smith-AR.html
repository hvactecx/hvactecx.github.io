<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Fort Smith AR</h3>
<p>A split a/c system may cost close to that of a conventional HVAC system but has shown to be an alternative cost effective alternative to houses that do not have ductwork. Used along with other forms of heating or cooling, such as portable or window a/c unit, space heaters, or oil heaters, it can boost the comfort of your house while keeping your monthly utility costs sensible.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
