<p>We take a look at clues prior to we offer guidance to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting money by not changing the older system.<p>

Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil.

The next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter requires changing.
