<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
