<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must look out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
