An example of time control is arranging floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

One of the main locations where clogs start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
