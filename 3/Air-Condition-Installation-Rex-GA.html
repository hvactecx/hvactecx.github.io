<p>The exhaust outlets permit all unsafe gases to escape your home so there's no risky buildup of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. They can lead to an unsafe accumulation and compromise your safety if the exhaust outlets are obstructed. The technician will examine all of these aspects of your system and inspect the chimney flue and vent stack as well. They will look for signs of deterioration, leaks, and back draft and repair the issue throughout their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
