<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is often important to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent ought to request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information may identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, monitoring data may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
