<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
