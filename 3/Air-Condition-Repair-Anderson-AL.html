<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if needed, update the building envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more effective solution to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were popular in the very first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial buildings, apartment and large houses. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, since the lack of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement expenses between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>

<p>Some illness, like humidifier fever, are related to exposure to toxins from microbes that can grow in big structure ventilation systems. However, these diseases can also be traced to bacteria that grow in house heating and cooling humidifiers and systems. Children, senior individuals, and individuals with breathing problems, allergies, and lung diseases are particularly prone to disease-causing biological agents in the indoor air.<p>
<p>Property owners might also presume that since a glowing floor heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a home improvement, its installation will immediately raise their home's value. No evidence exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or adversely impacts residential or commercial property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Value Report issued by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Improvement Publication. Perhaps Real estate agents should consider too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heat system might contribute to, or deduct from, any given asking rate. That stated, homebuyers seeking to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>
