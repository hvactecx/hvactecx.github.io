<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, specifically if you live in a place that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, debris, bacteria, and tidy the air.
