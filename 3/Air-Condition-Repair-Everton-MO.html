Insulation may be a more effective service to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Picture 6).<p>
