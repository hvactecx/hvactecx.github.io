When you choose Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not need to stress over a thing.<p>

The EPA study prescribed and controlled techniques used on a smaller number of homes. While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have defects, no other research has challenged the findings. And although the equipment and approaches utilized by duct-cleaning companies have changed because these research studies were conducted, the duct in houses haven't.<p>

<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
