<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted 2 local companies for bids. While both were useful and handy, Ballard Gas provided us a much better offer, for extraordinary service. Rather than an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating unit and situated methods we could have more even heat. He consisted of these substantial but minor adjustments in his quote. We chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump because of recent warmer summers and for environmental reasons.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time.

<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
