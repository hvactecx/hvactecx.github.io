<p>The very first air conditioners and fridges utilized poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While room cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more expensive than central air.<p>
