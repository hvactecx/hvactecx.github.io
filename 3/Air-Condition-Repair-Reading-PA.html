<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in gathering details on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.
