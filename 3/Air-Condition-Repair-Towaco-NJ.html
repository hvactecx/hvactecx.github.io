<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one environmental hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. When a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead enters the body. Before it was understood how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, fuel, water pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been shown to trigger the health effects mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the effects noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels usually found in the home. In a lot of cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health effects is too minimal to identify the levels at which the listed results might take place.<p>
