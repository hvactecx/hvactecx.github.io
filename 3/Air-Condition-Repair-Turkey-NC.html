<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Turkey NC</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We selected getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility costs.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
