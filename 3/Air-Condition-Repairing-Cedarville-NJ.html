ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install examination results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
