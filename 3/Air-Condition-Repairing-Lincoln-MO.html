<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
