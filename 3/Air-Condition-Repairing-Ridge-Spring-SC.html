The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
