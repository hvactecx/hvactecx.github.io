<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace specialists frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>For example, issues emerge when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in appropriate quantities of outside air. Inadequate ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or placed in such a way that outside air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building residents. Incorrectly located outside air consumption vents can likewise generate air contaminated with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological impurities that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>

Even if the opening is small, air will move until the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
