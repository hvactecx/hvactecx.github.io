Sources of formaldehyde in the house include building materials, smoking, family items, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating systems.

<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Waynesboro Virginia</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter when every 3 months. During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
