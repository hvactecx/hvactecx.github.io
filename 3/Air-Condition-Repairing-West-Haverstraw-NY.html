<p>Expert heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC professionals advise following this basic guideline when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can maximize efficiency and offer longer long lasting house heating.

The choice to repair or replace is up to you, and often it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into account the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a brand-new furnace that likely provides greater energy efficiency and includes warranty protection.<p>
