<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
<p>Typically the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is likewise a more affordable technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later in this area.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, human beings exhale co2, which in little quantities is not hazardous, however might become dangerous if high concentrations are enabled to accumulate. Micro-organisms or bacteria might also be present within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the entire workplace or building by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
