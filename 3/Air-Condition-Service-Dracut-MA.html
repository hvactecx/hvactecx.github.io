<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies.

Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
