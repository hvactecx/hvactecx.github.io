<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
