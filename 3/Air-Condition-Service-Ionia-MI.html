Such a tool must recognize the number of individuals impacted; specify ages and task descriptions of involved employees; identify where they lie within the workplace; suggest when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and time of year); offer a list of particular health symptoms or illnesses; identify all machines operated in the work environment; suggest the type of outdoors air contamination; and identify possible sources of task tension.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
