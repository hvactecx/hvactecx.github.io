<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
