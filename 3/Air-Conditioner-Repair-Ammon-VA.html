<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company utilized 98% of the existing product acquired with your house.

<h3>How To Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Ammon VA</h3>
<p>In-floor heating systems can come with specific health advantages. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you simply can't seem to heat up and find you require to show up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses throbbing. In-floor heating systems are not prone to this concern due to the fact that they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Furthermore, given that they do not rely upon fans, ducts, returns and registers to disperse hot air, in-floor heater can reduce the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your home.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Ammon VA</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC man and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
