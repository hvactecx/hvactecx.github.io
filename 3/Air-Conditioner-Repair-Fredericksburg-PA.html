<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in effectiveness advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions because they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Because a system is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
