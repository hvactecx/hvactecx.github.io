<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, instead of outdoor or commercial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might also include the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to individual areas.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can likewise intensify indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system may be polluted (due to the fact that of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system might spread these contaminants throughout the house.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
