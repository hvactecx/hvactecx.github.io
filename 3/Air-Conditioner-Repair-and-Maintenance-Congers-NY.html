<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be living in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar.

Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
