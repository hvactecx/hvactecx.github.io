<h3>What to Look for When Hiring an Greenwood IN HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different home efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to assist us discuss which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's services and products was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the essential electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>Ductwork Cleaning in Greenwood IN</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
