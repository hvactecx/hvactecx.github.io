<p>I am a real estate investor, I need to change two heaters in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as developing materials, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch pollutants basically constantly.

<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems.

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
