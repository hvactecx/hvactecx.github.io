<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the performance and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers ought to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
