<h3>Electric Boiler Repair in Northfield Minnesota</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
