<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate.

Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you might have a water leak in the attic. The water triggers your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace.
