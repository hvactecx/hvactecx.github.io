<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>

Not just are heat pumps convenient, they are incredibly energy efficient, too.
