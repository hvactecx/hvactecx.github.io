<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 should not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC use the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for generating power in the form of electrical power. The 2 operations use various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its goals.<p>
