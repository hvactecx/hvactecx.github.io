<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
