He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones received. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install assessment results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
