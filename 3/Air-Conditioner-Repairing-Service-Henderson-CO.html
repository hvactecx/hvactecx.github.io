<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
