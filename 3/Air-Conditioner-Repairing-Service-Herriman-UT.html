Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your house still warms to the best temperature level.

However, if your system does not appear to be working effectively, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you must call in an expert to repair the unit and check.<p>
