<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
