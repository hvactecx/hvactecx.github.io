<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who reside in the house. Toxins could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care items. Infections and germs, pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the United States your home lies, the local region's environment can change significantly.

A house in the Northern part of the United States would require a much larger heating capacity also which will impact expenses.
