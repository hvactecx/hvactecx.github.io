<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, since it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>

But more complex concerns-- determined by consistently unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack.
