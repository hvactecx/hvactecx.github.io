<p>Professional heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC professionals suggest following this basic guideline when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical functions of eco-friendly homes as part of the growing green structure motion.
