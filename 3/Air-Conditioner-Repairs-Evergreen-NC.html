<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is frosty, the evaporator coil is probably frozen. Likewise, if the air conditioning system smells bad, there could be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat far from your home. It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to replace the a/c unit's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed just a couple of years earlier.<p>
