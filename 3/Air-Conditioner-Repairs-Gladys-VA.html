<p>A customized ac system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the very same air path. A basic air conditioning system transfers heat out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, because all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is really warmed, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
