<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the increase it needs from the capacitor. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has failed. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the opportunities are good that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor environmental quality") explains how within air can affect a person's ability, convenience, and health to work.

This makes geothermal heating a reputable and offered source of energy.<p>
