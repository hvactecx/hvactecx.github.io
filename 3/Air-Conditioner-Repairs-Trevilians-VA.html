<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends on several elements consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends upon private level of sensitivity, which varies significantly from individual to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical contaminants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>For instance, problems emerge when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate appropriate quantities of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also takes place if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or positioned in such a way that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building residents. Incorrectly located outside air intake vents can also bring in air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>

<p>Particular immediate impacts are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically tough to identify if the symptoms are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is important to pay attention to the time and place the symptoms take place. If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is far from the house and return when the person returns, an effort must be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects might be worsened by an inadequate supply of outside air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions prevalent in the house.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
