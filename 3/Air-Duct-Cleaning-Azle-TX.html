<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
