<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Bainbridge GA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
