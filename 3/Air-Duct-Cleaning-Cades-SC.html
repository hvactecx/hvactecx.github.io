<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two ought to not be confused.

The two operations use different processes, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to attain its goals.<p>
