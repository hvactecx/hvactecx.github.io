<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>If you are thinking about installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house, plan on spending a number of thousand dollars for the total system.

<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
