<h3>Getting Through Central Heating Installation in Hermitage TN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
