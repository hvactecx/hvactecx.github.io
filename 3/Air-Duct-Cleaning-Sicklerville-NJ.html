<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a portion efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the manufacturer's instructions.<p>
