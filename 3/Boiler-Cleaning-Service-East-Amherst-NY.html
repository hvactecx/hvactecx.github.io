<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
