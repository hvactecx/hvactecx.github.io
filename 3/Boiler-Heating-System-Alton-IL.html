Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures often used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to supply thermal convenience indoors.

Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is really warmed, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
