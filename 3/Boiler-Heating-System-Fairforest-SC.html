<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the very same in all other locations.<p>
