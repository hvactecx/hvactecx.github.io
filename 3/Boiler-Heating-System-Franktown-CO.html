<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis might end up being stopped up, minimizing air circulation circulation, volume, and quality.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold.

Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
