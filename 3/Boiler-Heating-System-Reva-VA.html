<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was very happy they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be using them again.<p>

<p>The most underrated HVAC part in your air conditioning system is the evaporator & condenser coil. The majority of people believe the compressor is the only part that matters when making a big HVAC choice on changing your devices.

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
