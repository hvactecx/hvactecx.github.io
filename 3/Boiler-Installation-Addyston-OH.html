<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
