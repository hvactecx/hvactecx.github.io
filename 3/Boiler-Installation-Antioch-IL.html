<p>The purpose of many building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing security at reasonable energy expenses. Load calculating is described as the Manual J calculation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or unit cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video footage alone. Just like measuring the size of a system required based on BTUs, determining the correct size of system for your home likewise depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
