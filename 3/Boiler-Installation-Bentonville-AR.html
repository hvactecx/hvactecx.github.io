In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>A/c makers typically make rugged, high quality items. Start by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working.
