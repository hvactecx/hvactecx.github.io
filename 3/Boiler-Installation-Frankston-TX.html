<p>The most harmful asbestos fibers are too little to be noticeable. After they are breathed in, they can stay and collect in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be deadly). Symptoms of these illness do not show up until several years after direct exposure started. Many people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some industrialized illness from exposure to clothing and equipment brought house from job sites.<p>
