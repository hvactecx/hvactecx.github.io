<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize.

<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the professionals believed they just didn't appear best and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
