<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that ideal temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service plan which typically includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's development doesn't necessarily translate to the experience of operating an HVAC company. The heating, ventilation and air conditioning company tends to run cold and hot. Demand heats up throughout the summertime and winter when customers need their HVAC systems repaired for relief versus the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather condition gets here.<p>
