<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
