<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have.
