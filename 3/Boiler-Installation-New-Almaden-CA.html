<p>Utilize or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common technique of lowering direct exposure to indoor air toxins, also will minimize but not get rid of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Since smoking cigarettes produces such big amounts of pollutants, natural or mechanical ventilation methods do not eliminate them from the air in your home as rapidly as they develop. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it requires to substantially minimize direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses substantially. Consequently, the most efficient method to minimize direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the home is to eliminate smoking cigarettes there.<p>

<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated delay functions when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
