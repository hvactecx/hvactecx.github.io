<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Spring Valley CA?</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
