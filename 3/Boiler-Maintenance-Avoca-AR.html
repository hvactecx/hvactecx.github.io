Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Individuals who are allergic to these contaminants ought to utilize allergen-proof mattress encasements, wash bed linen in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and avoid room home furnishings that accumulate dust, specifically if they can not be washed in hot water.
