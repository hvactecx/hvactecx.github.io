<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

This is much more economical on a smaller scale. Bigger renovations like additions to a house might be suitable for a larger scale and more pricey hydronic system.<p>
