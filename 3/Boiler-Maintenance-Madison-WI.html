<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have actually been effectively dried. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
