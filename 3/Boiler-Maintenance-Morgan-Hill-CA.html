<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
