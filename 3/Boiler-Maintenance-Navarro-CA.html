<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
