<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
