<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
