<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was really extensive and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Also Camryn offered terrific customer care at the end of the consultation by describing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance jobs we might want to have carried out in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and solidify-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
