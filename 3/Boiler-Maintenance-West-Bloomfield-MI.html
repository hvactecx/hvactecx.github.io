There are numerous design techniques in usage today; however, all ground source heatpump run with comparable concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth.

As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
