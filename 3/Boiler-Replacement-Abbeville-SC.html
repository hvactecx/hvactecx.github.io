Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
