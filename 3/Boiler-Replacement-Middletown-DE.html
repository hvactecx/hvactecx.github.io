<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a very pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
