We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We picked getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
