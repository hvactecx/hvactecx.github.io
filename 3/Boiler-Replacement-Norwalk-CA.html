<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Contractor in Norwalk</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
