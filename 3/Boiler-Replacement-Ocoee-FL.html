<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their total power ought to not surpass the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, since the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, given that it takes into account not only the small power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
