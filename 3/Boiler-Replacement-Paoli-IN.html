<p>Immediate results may show up after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are normally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely removing the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined.

<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly may become blocked, lowering air flow distribution, volume, and quality.

Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
