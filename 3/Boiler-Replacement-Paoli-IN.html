<p>Immediate results may show up after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are normally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely removing the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Signs of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise appear soon after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly may become blocked, lowering air flow distribution, volume, and quality. They also might become places for bacteria and molds to be and grow dispersed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be effectively maintained to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
