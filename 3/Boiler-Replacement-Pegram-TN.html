<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Pegram TN</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
