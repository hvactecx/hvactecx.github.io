<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post set up inspection outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
