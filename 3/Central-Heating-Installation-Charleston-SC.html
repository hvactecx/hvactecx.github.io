<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>A geothermal heater does not create its power by burning fossil fuels such as oil, coal, or gas. Rather, it soaks up heat from within the earth.

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capacity and efficiency if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major downside of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
