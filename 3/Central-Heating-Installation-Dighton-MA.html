<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " primary ecological risk to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was known how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs in between $300 to $500 on average. It's the ductwork that delivers cold air to each room in your home, and if it develops cracks which leakage, they require to be fixed. Having defective ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse results. Your house will not be properly cooled, and your energy bills will go up. Installing new ductwork for the entire house will cost approximately in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
