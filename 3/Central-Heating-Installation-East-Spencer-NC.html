<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might grovel two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up simply a few years ago.<p>
<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
