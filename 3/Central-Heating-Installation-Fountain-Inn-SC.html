<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years earlier and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in place. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often hard to measure, as one action stated the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c do not just break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the result of repetitive usage of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, causing holes and fractures. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  a very useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
