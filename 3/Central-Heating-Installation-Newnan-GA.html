<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
