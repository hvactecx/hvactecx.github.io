<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are ranked 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient.

Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>
