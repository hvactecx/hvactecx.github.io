<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
