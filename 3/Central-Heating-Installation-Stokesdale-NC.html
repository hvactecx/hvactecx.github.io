<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these gadgets doubts since they just partially eliminate the radon decay products and do not decrease the quantity of radon entering the home.

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies more info on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>
