<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 must be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
