<p>As with many home enhancement jobs, the cost of a complete central heating system can vary extensively based on the size of the home. Many heaters will last between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, property owners must think about heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the house. A small home, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and shut off for too long, leading to irregular temperature levels.<p>
