<h3>Furnace Replacement in Norco CA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system".

The outdoor condenser system likewise changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
