Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
