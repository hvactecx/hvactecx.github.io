<p>EHSI's indoor air quality team excels in including a multidisciplinary approach to indoor air quality (IAQ) challenges. When estimating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimation bracket is in between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the type of system you choose for your house. Installation aside, you will still need to call out a qualified electrical contractor to connect the system to your power supply, this may take a few hours and can cost anything between $200 and $250 dependant on who you choose and where you live.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
