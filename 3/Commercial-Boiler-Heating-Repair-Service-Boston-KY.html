<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can manage, a lot of Seattleites need to find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a harsh, vicious summertime.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
