Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
