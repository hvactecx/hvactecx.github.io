<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is always at a constant temperature. These systems can achieve a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season.

<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the specialists believed they just didn't appear best and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
