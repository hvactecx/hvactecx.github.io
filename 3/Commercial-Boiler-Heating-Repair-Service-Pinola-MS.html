<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
