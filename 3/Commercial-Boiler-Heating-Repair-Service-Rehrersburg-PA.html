<p>Enhance your services, earn more services revenue, and provide a fantastic customer experience. To make certain the system you pick is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation quote to identify the specific type of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply change it with the same size unit you presently have. These estimations consider things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is vital so the unit isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>Rising energy expenses are not the only factor for high bills. Heaters typically lose their effectiveness as they age, especially if they have not been appropriately kept.

Start to compare the cost of your current heating bills with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a significant difference, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>
