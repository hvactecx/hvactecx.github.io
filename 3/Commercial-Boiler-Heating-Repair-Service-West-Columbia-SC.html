<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps guys working. When a sales man comes to your house he is there to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and ought to not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the options for your requirements and you choose if you require it.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Cheap AC Units in West Columbia SC</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most economical if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a variety of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has identified structure products, furnishings, and mold as serious issues, but much of the danger also comes from burning things. For example, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop contamination in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big issue in the developing world.<p>
<p>Mobile houses are typically smaller than stick-built residential or commercial properties and use significantly less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat. Anticipate the average mobile home oil furnace to have starting expenses of around $1,500. Keep in mind that not as lots of brand names produce oil heaters for this usage, and you might find more options with gas, lp, or electric heaters.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new homes are beginning to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house. Some of these designs consist of energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (likewise known as air-to-air heat exchangers). To find out more about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Conservation and Renewable Energy Questions and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
