<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Numerous efforts imagine to decrease indoor air contamination by limiting VOC emissions from products. There are policies in France and in Germany, and various voluntary ecolabels and rating systems containing low VOC emissions criteria such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Comfort 22 in Europe, along with California Requirement CDPH Section 01350 23 and a number of others in the U.S.A.. These efforts changed the market where an increasing variety of low-emitting products has appeared throughout the last years.<p>
<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor starts however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan starts. , if it does not, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
