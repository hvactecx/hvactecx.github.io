<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
