<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
