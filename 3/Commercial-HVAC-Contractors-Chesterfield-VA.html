<h3>Furnace Repair in Chesterfield Virginia</h3>
<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it needs from the capacitor. You can often conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the possibilities are good that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>

<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces in Chesterfield VA</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require reasonably little attention. However, similar to any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is essential to keep the system operating efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of standard hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank should be checked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed occasionally to get rid of tank and collected impurities (scaling in hard water areas). The systems need to be inspected at least two times per year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed regularly to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
