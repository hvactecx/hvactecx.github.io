The marketing portion of your company prepare for an HVAC company need to include how you'll advertise these types of services.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
