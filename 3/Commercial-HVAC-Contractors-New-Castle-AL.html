<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the proper temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
