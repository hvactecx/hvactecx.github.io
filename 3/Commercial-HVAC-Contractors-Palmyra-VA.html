<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards normally total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial price of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during brand-new building and construction (homes typically use in between one and five lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are lowering expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the best conditions.<p>
