<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
