Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>

<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate contaminants straight from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>

<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by most public water supplies, it has been discovered in well water. If you have actually evaluated the air in your house and found a radon issue, and you have a well, get in touch with a lab licensed to measure radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon issues in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for greater airflow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and new air filtration technologies are becoming more common as available solutions in residential and commercial HVAC product bundles. Adoption of these technologies, however, has not been extensive, as consumers stay largely unconcerned to the results of air quality on health and performance.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak with your medical professional about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to provide sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
