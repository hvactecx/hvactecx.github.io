<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. Be sure to have those measurements on hand when shopping for an air conditioning system to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window. Also, keep fire safety in mind when choosing where to install the ac system: Do not position it in an egress window that acts as the only means of escape should a fire appear.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can afford, many Seattleites should discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a cruel, terrible summer.<p>
<p>Sometimes a temporary indoor air quality problem is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complex concerns-- identified by regularly undesirable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 strategies listed below may be suitable.<p>
