Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the building (e.g., workplace devices; flooring, wall and furnishings coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater.
