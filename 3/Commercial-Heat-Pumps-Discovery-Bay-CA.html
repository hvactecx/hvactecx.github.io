<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my services, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on price. It's tough to discover a truthful AC person and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
