This might be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
