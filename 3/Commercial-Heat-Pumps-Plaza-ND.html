<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals utilized in the building or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can likewise produce particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
