<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the higher temperature levels sometimes utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness indoors is related to a higher occurrence of resident breathing issues.<p>
