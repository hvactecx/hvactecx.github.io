<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing product bought with your house.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
