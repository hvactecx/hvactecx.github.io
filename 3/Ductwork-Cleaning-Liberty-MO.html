<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable resource area suggests that "Air Filtering ought to have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to reduce the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can work as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can decrease the performance of the coils.<p>
<p>Geothermal a/c is a wise and cost-effective  method to cool down your house or place of business when the temperature levels keep climbing up.
