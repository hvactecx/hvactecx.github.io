<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them until they have actually been effectively dried. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
