<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
