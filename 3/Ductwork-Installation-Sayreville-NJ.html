<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
