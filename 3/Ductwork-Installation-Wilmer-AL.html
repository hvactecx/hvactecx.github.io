There are emergency security changes that protect your a/c system from flooding. One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you might have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
