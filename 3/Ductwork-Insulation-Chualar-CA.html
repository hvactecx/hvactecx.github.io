<p>Specialist heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC experts suggest following this standard rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>
