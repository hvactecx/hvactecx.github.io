<p>The Workplace tab includes the number of jobs kept in the profession and describes the work environment, the level of exercise expected, and typical hours worked. It may likewise talk about the significant industries that used the profession. This tab might also explain opportunities for part-time work, the amount and kind of travel required, any security equipment that is used, and the threat of injury that employees might deal with.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.
