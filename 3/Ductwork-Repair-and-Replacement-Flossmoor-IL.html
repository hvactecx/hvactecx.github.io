<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
