<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
