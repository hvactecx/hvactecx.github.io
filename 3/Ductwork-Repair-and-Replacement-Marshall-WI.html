<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics lately, however I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
