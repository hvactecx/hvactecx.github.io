<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
