<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe in addition to the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. There are numerous style methods in use today; however, all ground source heatpump run with similar principles. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning unit and refrigerators employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to deadly accidents when they dripped.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
