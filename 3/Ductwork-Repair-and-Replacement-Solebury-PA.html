<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the possible to negatively affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very little particles of dust.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
