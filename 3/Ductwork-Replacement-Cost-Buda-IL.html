<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Buda IL</h3>
<p>Specific immediate effects resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently challenging to figure out if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is important to take note of the time and location symptoms take place. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the area, for instance, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in automobiles in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC professionals. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by many people.<p>
