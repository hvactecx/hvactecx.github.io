<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
