Not only was the price terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
