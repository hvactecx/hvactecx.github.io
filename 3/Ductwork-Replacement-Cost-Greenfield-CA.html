<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: buy advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we solved issues. I would suggest this product to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time.

Throughout the examination on a very cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health risk factor and contractor laws for their choice.
