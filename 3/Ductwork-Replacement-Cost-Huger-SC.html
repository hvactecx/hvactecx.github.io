<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Huger SC?</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and final flooring surface. This is typically used in a third-floor or second area and makes the most of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
