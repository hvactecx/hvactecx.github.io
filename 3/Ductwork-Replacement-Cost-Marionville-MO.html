Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly might become clogged up, decreasing air flow quality, distribution, and volume.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be properly kept to avoid germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is often important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer.

Review of this information might determine possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, monitoring data might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
