And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies monthly might be used to help you pay for a new, a lot more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating expenses with heating costs from the previous years. If there is a considerable difference, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>
