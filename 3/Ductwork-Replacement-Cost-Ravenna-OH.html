<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Ravenna OH</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
