<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
