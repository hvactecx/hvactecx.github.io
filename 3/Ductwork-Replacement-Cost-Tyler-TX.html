<p>Some health impacts might show up quickly after a single exposure or duplicated direct exposures to a contaminant. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate effects are normally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is simply removing the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Soon after exposure to some indoor air contaminants, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma may show up, be aggravated or gotten worse.<p>
