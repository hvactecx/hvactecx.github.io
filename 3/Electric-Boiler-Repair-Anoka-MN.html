<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>
