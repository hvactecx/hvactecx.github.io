<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are used to seeing this key in the yards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box beyond the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal elements as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling multiple spaces simultaneously, but are not very energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the same time, the con would be that those who use this may invest more money on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
