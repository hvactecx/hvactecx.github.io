<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or listed below 65%.
