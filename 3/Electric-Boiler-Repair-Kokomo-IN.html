<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
