<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was type of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems.
