The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
