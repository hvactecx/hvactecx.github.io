<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
