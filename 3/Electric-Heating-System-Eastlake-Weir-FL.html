<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
