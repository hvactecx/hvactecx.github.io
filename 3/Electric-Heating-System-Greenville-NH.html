<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Gas heating systems do include some disadvantages. The greatest drawback is likewise the outcome of the combustion procedure.
