<p>Furnaces as they age run the risk of establishing cracks in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide, if present, could leak into your house undetected. Signs of this might be frequent headaches, a burning feeling in nose or eyes, queasiness, disorientation, flu-like signs. Must you experience any of these, air out your house, open a window to the furnace room and instantly call a service technician. Cracks in the heat exchanger can occur undetected which is why nobody advises waiting till they take place.

<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is much more than other heat pump types when installing the whole system. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one included excavation, running hundreds of backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is rather pricey. Installing a brand-new geothermal heatpump to work with an existing ground loop is far more affordable.<p>
<p>In addition, property owners have a range of options to select from in powering a floor heating unit. Glowing systems work with electrical, natural gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources. As many homeowners are all too conscious, tradition furnace systems are generally restricted to operating on a single energy source, such as heating oil. If the marketplace for that energy source turns unpredictable, rates can vary, rates surge and you can end up paying more to heat your house regardless of how low you set your thermostat.<p>

<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually viewed the single-family home installation service completely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living.
