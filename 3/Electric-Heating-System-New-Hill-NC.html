<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a big retailer who asked not to be named since he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps an eye on energy intake and temperature levels in stores to save on expenses (especially at night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores vary outside of an acceptable range that might prevent consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
