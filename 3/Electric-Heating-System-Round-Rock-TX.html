<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for several years. However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel expenses unexpectedly appear greater than typical, it is most likely time to think about a new system.

Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you ought to contact an expert to repair the system and check.<p>
