This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Because resistance varies significantly from specific to private, it is not practical to develop a universal guideline fit for all in terms of exposure and health.
