<p>Though it may be difficult to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for reducing the air quality in your home, but there are numerous other pollutants that can not only unclean up the air, but result in other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building materials contribute to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unstable natural substances) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery products can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big photo" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to offer threshold informs.

From there you can take the proper action to deal with the scenario instantly.<p>
