<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Mobile homes are usually smaller sized than stick-built homes and utilize significantly less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat. Anticipate the average mobile home oil furnace to have starting expenses of around $1,500. Keep in mind that not as many brands produce oil furnaces for this use, and you might find more alternatives with gas, lp, or electric furnaces.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of brand-new homes are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house. Some of these styles include energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also called air-to-air heat exchangers).
