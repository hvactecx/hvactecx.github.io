From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some standard maintenance.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
