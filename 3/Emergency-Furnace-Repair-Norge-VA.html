<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on occupants-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
