<p>Heating systems are like automobiles. As they age, you can change one part just require another part replaced or fixed next year. It doesn't take long to invest $500 just to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Heaters incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair sign is whether you needed to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts.

<p>Mentioning air, radiant heat systems tend to enhance indoor air quality. This is because forced air heating systems distribute airborne pollutants throughout the house during operation, provoking a variety of various negative impacts. Radiant heating systems don't distribute air at all, which in fact enhances your indoor air quality by limiting your exposure to high levels of airborne contaminants.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
