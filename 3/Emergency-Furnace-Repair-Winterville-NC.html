<p>I have been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC man and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
