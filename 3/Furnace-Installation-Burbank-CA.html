Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a home can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found simply a couple of feet below ground. In the summer months, the process reverses, consequently cooling a house by removing heat. Underground temperature level remains continuous no matter the environment, so geothermal systems supply constant and trusted heating and cooling.<p>

<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might choose to change the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system. If you do so, seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system. Nevertheless, considering current changes in refrigerants and cooling designs, it may be smarter to change the whole system.<p>
