<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have actually been effectively dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
