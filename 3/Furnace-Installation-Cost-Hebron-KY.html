<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition worsened by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes nose, throat, and eye irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Dirty Filters: √¢ $ " √Ç Filters blocked with dust, animal hair and other particles lead to problems like failure to provide appropriate heat, excess noise and the furnace running all the time.

<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may choose to replace the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor unit.
