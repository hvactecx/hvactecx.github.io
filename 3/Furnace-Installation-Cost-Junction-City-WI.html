<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
