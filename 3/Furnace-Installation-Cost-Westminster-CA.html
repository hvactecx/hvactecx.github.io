<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash can be found in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Westminster CA</h3>
<p>Convected heat systems are significantly popular, especially in the previous quarter-century as technology has advanced, and the systems have shown themselves in dependability and economy. Unlike convection heating, convected heat systems have no air and no ductwork blood circulation. Radiant systems depend upon heat transfer by the infrared clinical concept used by the sun called line of sight." These invisible electro-magnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a contained system like a home, the warmer things naturally heat the cooler ones until a balance is achieved.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater due to the fact that the specialists believed they just didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
