<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor in Godfrey IL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
