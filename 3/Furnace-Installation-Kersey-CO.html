<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if essential, update the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more effective option to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>
