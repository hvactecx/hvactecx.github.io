Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil.
