<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Mc Intosh FL</h3>
<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated delay features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they detected the issue and repaired really rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for replacing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who described our alternatives did an outstanding job in making sure we comprehended the advantages and disadvantages of each choice. The technicians who set up the new system were fast and expert, while requiring time to ensure we comprehended how the brand-new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>
