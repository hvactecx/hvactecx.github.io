<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Problems in Princeton MN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
