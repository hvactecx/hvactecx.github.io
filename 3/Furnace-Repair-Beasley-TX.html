Today's heating systems are ranked 90% efficiency or better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase efficiency even further by running at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more effective than space ac system. In addition, they are out of the way, quiet, and practical to operate. To conserve energy and money, you should shop an energy-efficient air conditioner and minimize your central air conditioner's energy usage. In a typical air-conditioned home, cooling consumes more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy annually, triggering power plants to emit about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>

Additionally, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter when every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
