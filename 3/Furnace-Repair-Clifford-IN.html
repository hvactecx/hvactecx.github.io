<h3>Air Condition Repair in Clifford IN</h3>
<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As an initial step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
