<p>Structures are designed or planned to react actively to a few of these modifications around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
