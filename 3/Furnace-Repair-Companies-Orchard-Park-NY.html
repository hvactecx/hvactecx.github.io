<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the abilities or tools necessary to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and correct airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the essential devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>
