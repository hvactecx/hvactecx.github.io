<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
