<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately solidify and cure-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
