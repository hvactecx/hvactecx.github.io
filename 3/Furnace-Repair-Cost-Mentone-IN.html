<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that best temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service plan which generally includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for property owners to think about. Often times, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those wanting to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, because the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are typically just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
