<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for years. However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel costs unexpectedly seem greater than regular, it is most likely time to think about a new system.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They suggested changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was extremely happy they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
