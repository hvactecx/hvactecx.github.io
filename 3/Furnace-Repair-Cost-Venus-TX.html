<p>Remember that the SEER rating is determined using the same set of temperatures throughout the board. The typical summer season temperature level to arrive at the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to reach the proper SEER rating for your location, subtract 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating needs to be at least 13 for all new cooling systems produced in the United States.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for greater air flow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensing units, and new air filtration innovations are ending up being more common as available options in commercial and residential HVAC item packages. Adoption of these innovations, nevertheless, has not been widespread, as clients remain mainly oblivious to the results of air quality on health and performance.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
