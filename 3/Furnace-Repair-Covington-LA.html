<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner in Covington LA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
