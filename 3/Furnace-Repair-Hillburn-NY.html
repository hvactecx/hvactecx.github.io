I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he assisted me problem shoot the concern. He is honest, trusted, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
