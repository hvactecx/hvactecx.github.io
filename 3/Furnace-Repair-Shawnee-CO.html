<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same toxins.

<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas.

When radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and structures build up inside your home, direct exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>

Signs of these illness do not show up till several years after exposure began.
