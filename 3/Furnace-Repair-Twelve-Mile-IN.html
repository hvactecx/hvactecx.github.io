<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Twelve Mile IN</h3>
<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has watched the single-family house installation company completely flip on its head the last few years. Winter utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with newbies more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
