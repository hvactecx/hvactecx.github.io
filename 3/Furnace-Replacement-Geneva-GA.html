<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Once set up, underfloor heating requires essentially no maintenance and comes with a 30 Year Assurance for total peace of mind. The Warmup heating controllers will guarantee that your heating runs in the most efficient manner either immediately with a Smart WiFi Thermostat, or, if you wish, with a programmable thermostat that can be configured to ensure the heating comes on at certain times, providing you the choice to switch it off during the night time.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your car. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter when every three months. Throughout high usage months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
