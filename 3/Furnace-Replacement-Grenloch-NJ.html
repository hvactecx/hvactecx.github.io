<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
