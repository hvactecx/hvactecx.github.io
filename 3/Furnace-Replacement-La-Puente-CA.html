<p>There are numerous actions a homeowner can take to select items that will prevent indoor air problems from taking place - a couple of them are discussed here. Initially, use exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, think about utilizing solid wood products. Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that an effective wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of if it ends up being damp.<p>
