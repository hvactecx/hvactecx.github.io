<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers used different methods. The CMHC research study called on a number of duct-cleaning services.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them..

Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
