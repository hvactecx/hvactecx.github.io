Throughout usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transferred from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.
