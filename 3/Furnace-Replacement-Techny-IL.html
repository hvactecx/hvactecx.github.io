In this manner, they can evaluate the problem without increasing the threat of infection transmission by visiting your home.<p>
<p>Typically the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may position threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
