<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
