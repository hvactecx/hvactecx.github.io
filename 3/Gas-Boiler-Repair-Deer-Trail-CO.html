<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Humid and wet conditions reproduce mold and mildew that can activate breathing issues like allergic reactions and asthma. Depending upon your location, the hot summer months can cause particularly damp conditions. Decrease the amount of wetness in the air and curb the growth of annoying molds with a few well-placed dehumidifiers. There are a range of humidifier choices that will help maintain consistent humidity levels and produce comfy living conditions in your home.<p>
