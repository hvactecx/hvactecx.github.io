(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
