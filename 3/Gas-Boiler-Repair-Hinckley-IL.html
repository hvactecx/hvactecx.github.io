<p>Since an a/c unit moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in gathering details on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
<p>Stability Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new heating systems can heat the house. Truthfully, our home heating system is complicated, Rob and his group repaired the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
