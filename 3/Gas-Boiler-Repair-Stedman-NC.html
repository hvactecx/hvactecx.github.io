Consult your state's contractor's licensing board online to guarantee that no consumer problems have actually been submitted which the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and legitimate.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a referral in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
