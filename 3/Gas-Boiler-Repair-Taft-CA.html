<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was very thorough and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn offered fantastic customer support at the end of the visit by explaining exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance jobs we may want to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your house that ideal temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the roadway. So, make certain to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which usually includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>As pointed out above, activating your new under tile floor heating system prematurely, before the mortar has actually cured, can trigger the grout to split or to not adhere effectively, and may void the guarantee of your mortar product. In some screening, even the tile split when the system was run before the compound had treated. If you do not follow their guidelines, and mortar makers may refuse warranty protection.<p>
