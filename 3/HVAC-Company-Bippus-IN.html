<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
