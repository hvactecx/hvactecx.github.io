<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
