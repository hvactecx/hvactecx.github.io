<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping machine to flow hot water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the uniformity of the flooring heat transferred heat to other posts in the spaces, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Ductless heatpump are fantastic for additions since they do not need any new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
