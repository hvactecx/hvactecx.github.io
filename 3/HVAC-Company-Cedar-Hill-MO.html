<p>In addition to these weather condition changes, we've also been the country's fastest growing city over the last decade, adding well over 100,000 individuals, or a growth of 18.7 percent according to the Seattle Times In the majority of locations of our nation, cooling is a standard necessity, meaning the people that move here from out of state are most likely expecting to have cooling. Likewise, real estate rates in Seattle have actually skyrocketed, and as a result, newer houses are getting taller and skinnier, with bed rooms on the upper levels.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which generally consists of a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
