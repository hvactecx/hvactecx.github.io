<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these devices is uncertain due to the fact that they just partially eliminate the radon decay items and do not diminish the amount of radon getting in the house. EPA plans to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or could end up being, a reputable means of reducing the health threat from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers additional info on air-cleaning gadgets to reduce indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be induced as the result of temperature extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too little or too much air flow. Workplace temperatures should be kept in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts caused by excessive air blood circulation ought to be avoided.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants activate allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Contagious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxic substances. Symptoms of illness brought on by biological pollutants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and digestion issues.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days might end up being a source for mold growth and need to be disposed of. In some cases there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen.

In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances exist will be mold growing close by. Fix the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the area utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
