<p>Just like the majority of house improvement jobs, the cost of a complete central heater can differ extensively based on the size of the home. The majority of furnaces will last in between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, property owners should consider heat output and performance.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not use them..

Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
