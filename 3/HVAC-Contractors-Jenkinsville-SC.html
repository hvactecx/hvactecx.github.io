He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent people I have actually fulfilled in a long time. If we want to have options to ACME heating, we need to support the real individuals who are there for us.

No extra charge.<p>
