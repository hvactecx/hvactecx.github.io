<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
