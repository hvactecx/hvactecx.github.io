<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
