<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Ilan always makes himself available - whether it's a heating issue in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is competent with these devices).

<p>Think about prospective effects of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the producer's directions, specifically directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
