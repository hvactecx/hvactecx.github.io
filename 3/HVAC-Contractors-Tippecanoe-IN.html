<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and homes matters, particularly because we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. A/c unit help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in extremely humid climates or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your house. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>A Trane a/c can range in cost from $4,000 - $10,000. Our prices guide discusses all the elements that impact your price.

<p>Many HVAC company owner don't understand they require different prices schemes for various services that their company uses.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
