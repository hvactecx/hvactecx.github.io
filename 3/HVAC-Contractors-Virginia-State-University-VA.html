<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply, glowing heat systems have actually been around because the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and an elementary pumping device to circulate warm water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the harmony of the floor heat transferred heat to other short articles in the rooms, consisting of the human occupants.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heating unit. You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.
