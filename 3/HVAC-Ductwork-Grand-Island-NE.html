<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in gathering info on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to briefly cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance.
