<p>Central air systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
