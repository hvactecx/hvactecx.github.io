<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces in Newtown IN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the system has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
