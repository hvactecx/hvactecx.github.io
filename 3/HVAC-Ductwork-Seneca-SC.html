Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that protect your a/c system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great opportunity; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
