From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had spotted the difficulty location in looking over the expense. He fixed the concern in one day, had adjusted the expense to what I thought about fair before he called back, understood what may have caused the issue and had a strategy to insure that it would not happen again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
