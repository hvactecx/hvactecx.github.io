Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
