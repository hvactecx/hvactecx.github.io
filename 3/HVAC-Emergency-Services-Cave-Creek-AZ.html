<p>. Prior to picking the installation area of a/c unit, several main aspects need to be thought about. Firstly, the direction of air flow from the indoor systems should not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Second of all, there need to not be any challenges en route of the airflow that might avoid it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.
