<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
