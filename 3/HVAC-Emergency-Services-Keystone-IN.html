Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
