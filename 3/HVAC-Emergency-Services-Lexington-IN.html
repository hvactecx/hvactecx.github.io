<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, rather than outdoor or industrial settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like an area heater) with the exact same quantity of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
