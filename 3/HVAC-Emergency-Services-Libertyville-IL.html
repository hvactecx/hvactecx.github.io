<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
