<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
