<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from procedures or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new homes are beginning to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. Some of these designs consist of energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers). To find out more about air-to-air heat exchangers, contact the Preservation and Renewable Resource Inquiry and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
