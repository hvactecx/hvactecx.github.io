<p>While radon in water is not a problem in houses served by most public water supplies, it has been discovered in well water. If you've checked the air in your home and found a radon problem, and you have a well, contact a lab certified to measure radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon issues in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>Our frigid Vermont winters need a correctly working heating system. When the furnace stops working completely or simply won't keep the house warm, it can quickly become too cold for your family to stay in your home. We have fully accredited and experienced technicians ready to respond to your call today. If your furnace breaks down after hours, we offer emergency service in the evening and on weekends.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but many use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is most likely a better service. If the present system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be determined and corrected, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
