<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Because it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness.
