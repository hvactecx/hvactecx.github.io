If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any airflow constraint will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>

Ron had actually identified the problem location in examining the expense. He dealt with the issue in one day, had actually adjusted the costs to what I thought about reasonable prior to he called back, understood what might have caused the issue and had a plan to guarantee that it would not take place again. I have actually considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have used them. This experience confirms that.<p>
