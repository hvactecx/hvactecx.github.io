Other possible sources of biological impurities are animals and household plants.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
