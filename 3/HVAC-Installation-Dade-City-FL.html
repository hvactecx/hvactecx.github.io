As a result your oil or natural gas furnace may run longer to provide the very same quantity of heat. This will trigger your energy expenses to go up. And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies every month might be used to help you pay for a brand-new, much more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating costs with heating expenses from the previous years. If there is a substantial difference, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
