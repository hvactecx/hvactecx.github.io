<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractors in Dallas</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet contains the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet includes the evaporator. In lots of split-system ac system, this indoor cabinet likewise includes a furnace or the indoor part of a heatpump.
