<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops ought to be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances ought to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also develop particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
