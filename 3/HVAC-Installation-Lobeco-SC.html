<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978.

All items in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, consisting of individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
