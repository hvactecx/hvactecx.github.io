<h3>Advantages of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces at Northbrook IL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
