Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are almost always utilized in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
