<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is frequently tough to measure, as one reaction stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of recurring usage of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering early degeneration, resulting in holes and fractures. , if that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.. a very helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
