<p>There are two main types of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating organisation. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are forced to resist current, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we advise using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of permitting heat to warm up the concrete slab listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
