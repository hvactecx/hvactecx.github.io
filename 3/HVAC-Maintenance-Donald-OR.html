The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
