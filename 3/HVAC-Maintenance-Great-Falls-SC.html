<h3>Air Condition Service Near me in Great Falls SC</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 should not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for producing power in the form of electricity. The 2 operations utilize various processes, with geothermal energy needing water be heated up to boiling point to attain its goals.<p>
