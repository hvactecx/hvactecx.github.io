<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
