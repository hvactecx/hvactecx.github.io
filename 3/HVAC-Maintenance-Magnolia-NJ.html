In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
