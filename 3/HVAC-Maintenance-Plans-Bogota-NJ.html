These systems can achieve a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only obtain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact.
