<p>Power Vac America supplies commercial, commercial, institutional, residential and marine air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services.

Depending upon its positioning on your home and its upkeep, it might sustain some damage during the winter.

Soil by highways and roads may be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet prior to entering the house. Change your clothes before you go house and wash these clothes independently if you work with lead in your task or a hobby. Encourage your kids to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which stays with fingers and toys. Try to keep your kids from consuming dirt, and make sure they wash their hands when they come inside.<p>
