However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
