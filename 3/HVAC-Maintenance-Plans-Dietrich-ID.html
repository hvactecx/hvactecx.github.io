<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
