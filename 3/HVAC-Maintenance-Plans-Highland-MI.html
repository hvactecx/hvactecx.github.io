<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the possible to adversely affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very small particles of dust.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
