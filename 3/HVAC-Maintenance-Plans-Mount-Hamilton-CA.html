<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
