<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
