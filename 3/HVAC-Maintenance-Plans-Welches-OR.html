Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure products, smoking, home products, and using unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heaters.

<p>The ability of organic chemicals to trigger health impacts differs significantly, from those that are highly toxic, to those without any known health result. As with other contaminants, the degree and nature of the health impact will depend upon numerous elements including level of exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and breathing system inflammation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders, and memory disability are amongst the instant signs that some people have experienced not long after exposure to some organics. At present, very little is learnt about what health results happen from the levels of organics generally found in homes. Lots of natural compounds are understood to cause cancer in animals; some are thought of causing, or are understood to trigger, cancer in humans.<p>
