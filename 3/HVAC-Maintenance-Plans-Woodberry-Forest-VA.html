<p>Prior to you head out and purchase an air conditioner, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the a/c? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioning system be? Too large and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioning unit won't be able to cool your home effectively. These are just a few of the factors that you require to take into consideration when buying a new AC system. Each choice can and will substantially impact your system's performance, which is why you can't manage to overlook any of them.<p>
<p>The most common type of house heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat.
