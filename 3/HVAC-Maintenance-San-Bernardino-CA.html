<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic.

He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair price.
