The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power must not surpass the capability of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%.

Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not easy, because it takes into account not just the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
