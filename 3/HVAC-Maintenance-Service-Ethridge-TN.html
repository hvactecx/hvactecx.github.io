<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
