<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an option for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, since the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.
