<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
