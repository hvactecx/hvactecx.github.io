<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of changing or exchanging air in any space to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior building air flowing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
