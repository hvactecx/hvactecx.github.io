<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
