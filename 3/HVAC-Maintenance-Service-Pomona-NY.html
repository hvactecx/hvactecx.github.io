<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and tied them into a hot water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping device to flow hot water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat transferred heat to other articles in the rooms, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>It may simply need to be cleaned if your central air conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running. Whether or not this is the cause of the problem, it's an excellent early solution to attempt. Plan to do this on a fairly warm day. Never use a power washer for this-- it can damage the fins. The following are guidelines; constantly describe your owner's manual. Note: Constantly shut off the power before cleaning the unit.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works however the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
