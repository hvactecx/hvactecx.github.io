<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limits utilize dose-response information which show the health impacts of repetitive exposure to one specific chemical. Similar information is not offered for long-lasting, low-level exposures to a mix of pollutants as holds true for IAQ problems.
