<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you must look out for. First, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.
