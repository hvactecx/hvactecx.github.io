<p>Indoor temperatures are often more challenging to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heater, think about prospective results of indoor air pollution. Follow the maker's instructions, especially instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually a sign of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heater is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
