<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Edisto Island South Carolina</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have two major parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>There is an essential balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE rankings typically feature higher price tags. So, make sure to choose based upon how frequently you will use your heating system, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year. For most temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter, having an incredibly high ranked heating unit is not constantly necessary.<p>
<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
