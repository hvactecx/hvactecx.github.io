Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, many of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item.
