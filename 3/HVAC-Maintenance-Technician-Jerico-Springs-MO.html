<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

If the sensing unit is knocked out of position, the a/c might cycle continuously or act unpredictably.
