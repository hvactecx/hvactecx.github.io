The OxyQuantum UV sterilization systems also help control bacteria and organic smells. Most store-bought filters can not remove these tiniest of allergens and don't get rid of germs and gases.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your automobile. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
