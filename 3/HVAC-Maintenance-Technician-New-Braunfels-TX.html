<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, given that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
