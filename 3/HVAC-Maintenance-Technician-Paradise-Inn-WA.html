<p>A specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the same air path. A standard ac system transfers heat out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
