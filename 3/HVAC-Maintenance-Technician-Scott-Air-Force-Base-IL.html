Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>

This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heating unit) with the exact same amount of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
