<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
