<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
