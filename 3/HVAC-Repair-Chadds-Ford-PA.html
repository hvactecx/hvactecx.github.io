<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally brought on by the lack of adequate ventilation, which results in a buildup of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the main issue in over half the workplace indoor air investigations it has actually conducted.

These examinations revealed that proper ventilation is necessary in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
