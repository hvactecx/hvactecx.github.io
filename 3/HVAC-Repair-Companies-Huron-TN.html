<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
