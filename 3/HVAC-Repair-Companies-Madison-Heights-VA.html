<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood items made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board contains a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is generally recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a circulation system. Metal pipelines are seldom utilized due to long-lasting corrosive issues.

However, assuming they are installed properly and properly taken care of, the possibility of them having issues is small.<p>
