<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, though, there will constantly be the odd problem that sometimes shows up. It is really important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible when you do observe your furnace behaving oddly.

<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the same duration.

The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>

This can be done through central heating Such a system includes a heat, boiler, or furnace  pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central area such as a furnace space in a house, or a mechanical space in a big building. The heat can be transferred by convection, radiation, or conduction Space heating units are utilized to heat single rooms and just consist of a single unit.<p>
<p>Another option to oil furnaces are gas heating systems While oil is typically utilized in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice between the 2 types. Gas furnaces cost about the exact same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The genuine advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home.
