<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak with your medical professional about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
