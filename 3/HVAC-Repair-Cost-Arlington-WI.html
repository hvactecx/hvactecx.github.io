<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
