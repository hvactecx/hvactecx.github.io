<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate since it just takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
