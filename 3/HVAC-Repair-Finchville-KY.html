<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring equipment will send the sensing unit information to the cloud, where you can access it through software. You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results through a dashboard, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to understand.<p>

<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can pay for, a lot of Seattleites need to find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a harsh, vicious summer.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
