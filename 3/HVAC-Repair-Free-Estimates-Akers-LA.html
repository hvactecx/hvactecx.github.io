<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

Exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes caught in structures and concentrations build up inside.<p>

<p>We're investing a lot more time inside, these days. While many individuals presume pollution is simply an outside issue, your home (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we do not believe enough about exposure to all the things we position in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a huge result on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- right away, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).

<p>Just like a lot of home enhancement tasks, the cost of a full central heating system can differ extensively based upon the size of the home. Most furnaces will last in between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, homeowner need to think about heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A small house, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and shut off for too long, leading to irregular temperature level levels.<p>
