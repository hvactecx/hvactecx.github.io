<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top environmental danger to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Before it was known how damaging lead might be, it was used in paint, gasoline, pipes, and lots of other items.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke causes nose, eye, and throat inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually linked exposure to secondhand smoke with the beginning of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can pay for, numerous Seattleites need to find ways to combat the heat without a duct system.

Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a harsh, vicious summer.<p>

Senseware, an intelligent building start-up understood for air quality monitoring, launched a solution bundle in partnership with other vendors to assist customers securely reopen their organisations. Molekule, a residential air purifier startup, introduced a brand-new product, now for healthcare use, and got a FDA 510( k) Class II Medical Gadget Clearance.<p>
