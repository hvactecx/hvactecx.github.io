So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 must be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements.
