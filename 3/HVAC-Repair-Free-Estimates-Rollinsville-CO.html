<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and therefore needs conditions appropriate for both organisms. The germs forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Removal for Legionella outbreaks in commercial structures differ, but often consist of very hot water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in many cases flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive measures consist of adjusting regular hot water levels to enable 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, evaluating facility style layout, removing faucet aerators, and routine screening in suspect locations.<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "routine" occupational exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to identify if the basic indoor air quality satisfies a certain requirement. Occupational exposure limits listed in health and safety guidelines and the Threshold Limit Values ® (TLVs) suggested by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are planned as a guide to prevent disease or certain impacts (like eye and nose inflammation) in industrial circumstances. These limits may not be suitable in office settings or for the home.<p>

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
