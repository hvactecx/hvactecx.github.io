After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency.

In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
