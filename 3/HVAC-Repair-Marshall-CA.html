<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have multiple control panel. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and manage of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control board must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t correctly identified, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed.
