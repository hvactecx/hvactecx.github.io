<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, considering that the overall capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not basic, since it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Image 6).<p>
