<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems at Elkhart IN</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit.

We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
