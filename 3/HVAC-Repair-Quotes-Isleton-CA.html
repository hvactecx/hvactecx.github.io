<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>I have actually used all the time for 5 plus years now. I have signed a yearly maintenance contract which covers two services every year. Ilan has actually been great through all these years. Always keeps my system serviced and tuned. Have not had any problems. Whenever he sees any problems, he informs me about it and proactively repairs the parts. Really pleased with their service. Would recommend them anytime.<p>
