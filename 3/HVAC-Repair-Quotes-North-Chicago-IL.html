<h3>Finding Best HVAC Contractors in North Chicago IL</h3>
<p>Often, heating repairs are simply not possible. Maybe your furnace is too old, your heat pump is too damaged, or your boiler simply can't be fixed. Whatever the case, specific instances call for full-scale heating replacement. At Horizon Services, we have been helping property owners throughout Delaware, Southern New Jersey, Southeastern Pennsylvania, and Northeastern Maryland change their homes' heater when their old ones are no longer functional.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
