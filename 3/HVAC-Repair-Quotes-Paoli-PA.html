<p>Specialist heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately stop working. HVAC experts advise following this basic rule when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>
