<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Raymond CA</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions call for.

Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
