<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized.

If your home is not heating up, only be concerned. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working effectively, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice.
