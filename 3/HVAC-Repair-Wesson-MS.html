<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
