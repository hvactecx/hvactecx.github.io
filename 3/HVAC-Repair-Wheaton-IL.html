<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
