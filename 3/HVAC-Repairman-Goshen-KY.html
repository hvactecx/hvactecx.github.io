<p>A main factor in the avoidance of health symptoms is an effective, correctly developed and running ventilation system. The ventilation system identifies the quality of the indoor air by controlling the quantity of air that is added to the office environment, the tidiness of such outside air, and the rate at which the workplace air and its pollutants are either exhausted to the outdoors or re-circulated throughout the building.<p>
<p>Some health effects might show up soon after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a toxin. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate effects are usually short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely eliminating the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, signs of some diseases such as asthma might show up, be aggravated or gotten worse.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
