<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no impurity sources are discovered. Extreme re-circulation of air causes "stagnant air" conditions.

<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an a/c unit moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<h3>HVAC Supply in Minneapolis MN</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold growth and need to be discarded. In some cases there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can prosper in concealed or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered.
