<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Terrific Product! Delivery was type of strange being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
