<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation also depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, variety in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heatpump generally need excavation to install, which adds a number of thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
