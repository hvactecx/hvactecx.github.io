<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, rather than industrial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building. It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to individual areas.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the ac system into a heatpump While space cooling provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air.<p>
