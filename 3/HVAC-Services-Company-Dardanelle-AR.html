<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
