<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
