As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the concern and fixed extremely quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heating systems have multiple control boards. The largest, or only one in some furnaces, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control panel should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t correctly identified, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
