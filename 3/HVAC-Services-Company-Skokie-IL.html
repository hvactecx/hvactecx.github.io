Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A little home, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too quickly and shut down for too long, leading to irregular temperature levels.<p>
