Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still does not work properly after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.
