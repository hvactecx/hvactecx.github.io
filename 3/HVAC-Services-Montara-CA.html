<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise managing the temperature level of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, many of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
