<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Since approximately 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage. Since they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
