<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Necessary Company in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are ranked 90% performance or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can indicate considerable cost savings in annual heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by running at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily incorporated with existing systems such as conventional forced air or glowing floor heating or can be installed in a brand-new structure. Required air systems will require a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heating systems will need water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop required depends upon the heating and cooling requirements for your home and is crucial iin ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is determined in lots. Generally, a 3-ton setup must be sufficient for the average house, however house size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land schedule are all factors which will influence the correct size for your particular home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you effectively size a system.<p>
