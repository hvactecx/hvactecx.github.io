<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the system has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
