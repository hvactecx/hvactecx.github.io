<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can indicate your house may not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, stinky or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To discover odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
