Likewise, tidy ducts and correct airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the essential equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician examine the system periodically.<p>
