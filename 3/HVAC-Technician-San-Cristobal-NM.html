The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
