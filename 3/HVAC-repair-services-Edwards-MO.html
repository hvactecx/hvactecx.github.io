<p>. Before picking the installation place of a/c unit, a number of primary factors need to be considered. First of all, the instructions of air flow from the indoor systems ought to not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Secondly, there should not be any challenges on the way of the airflow that may avoid it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit needs to also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully discharged outdoors and the performance of the entire system will drop greatly.

<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors.

More than one case has actually involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
