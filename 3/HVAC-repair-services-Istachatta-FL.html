<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
