<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Illness (BRI) refers to less frequent (but typically more serious) cases of people ending up being ill after remaining in a specific structure at a particular time. In these cases, there is generally a comparable set of clinical signs experienced by the individuals and a clear cause can frequently be found upon examination. Legionnaires Disease is an example of BRI triggered by bacteria which can pollute a structure's air conditioning system.<p>
<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly simple process. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite costly if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
