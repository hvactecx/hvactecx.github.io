<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems in homes. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the home. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance visits per year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and usually some other benefits. Some companies offer top priority visits to their maintenance strategy members.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your vehicle.

Throughout high use months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
