<h3>Furnace Installation Cost in Whiteville North Carolina</h3>
<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is frosty, the evaporator coil is probably frozen. Likewise, if the a/c unit smells bad, there might be germs buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your home.

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
