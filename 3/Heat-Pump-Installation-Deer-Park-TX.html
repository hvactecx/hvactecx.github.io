<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and offices matters, particularly given that we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in extremely damp environments or in cases where the ac system is large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning unit will need more energy to cool your house. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>More common in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electrical power, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual spaces. All-electric boilers can accomplish as much as 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
