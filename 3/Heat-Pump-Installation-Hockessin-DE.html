<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can end up being blocked with debris that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's performance. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, changing a furnace and examining filter can typically be performed in simply a couple of minutes, typically without any tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
