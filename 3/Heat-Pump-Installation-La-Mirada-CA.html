<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Factors that can add to the development of biological impurities are wet or wet building products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and poorly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease triggered by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Numerous fungis and germs grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are family pets and household plants.<p>

<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition worsened by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke triggers eye, nose, and throat inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>The primary health effect related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
