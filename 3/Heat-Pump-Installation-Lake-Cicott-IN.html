<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Lake Cicott IN</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
