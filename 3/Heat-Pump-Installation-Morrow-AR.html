<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
