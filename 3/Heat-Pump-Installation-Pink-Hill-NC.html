<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Company in Pink Hill</h2>

An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
