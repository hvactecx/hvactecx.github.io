Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>Air conditioner makers usually make rugged, high quality products. Begin by inspecting any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails.
