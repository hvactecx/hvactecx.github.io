<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Somerville OH</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various home efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us debate which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's product and services was excellent. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the required electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run. Because it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
