<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Others were nearly twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality.
