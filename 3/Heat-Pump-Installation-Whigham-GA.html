<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner in Whigham GA</h3>
<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality concerns. In the absence of such legislation, the "basic task stipulation" applies. This stipulation, common to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, states that a company needs to offer a safe and healthy  workplace. Thus, making certain the air is of excellent quality is the employer's responsibility.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
