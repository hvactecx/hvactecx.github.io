<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, because some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>

In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
