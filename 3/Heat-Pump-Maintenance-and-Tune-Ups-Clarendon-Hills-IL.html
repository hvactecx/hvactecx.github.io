<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to evaluate and, if necessary, upgrade the building envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more efficient service to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>

Only be worried if your home is not heating up. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working appropriately, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you should hire a specialist to check and repair the system.<p>
