<p>At present, EPA does not recommend utilizing air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay products. Since they only partly eliminate the radon decay items and do not diminish the amount of radon getting in the house, the efficiency of these gadgets is unpredictable. EPA prepares to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a trustworthy means of decreasing the health risk from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides additional information on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air pollutants.<p>

In addition to residential and commercial cooling and heating services, our local teams provide other services, consisting of carbon monoxide and smoke detector installation, thermostat installation, and indoor air quality options such as air filtration services and installation of humidifiers and dehumidifiers.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to offer threshold signals. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your tracking equipment to signal you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached crucial point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to resolve the scenario instantly.<p>
<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
