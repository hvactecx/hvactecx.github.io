<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Gaston IN</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being far more serious with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more traditional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
