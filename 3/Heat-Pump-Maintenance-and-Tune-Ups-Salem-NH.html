<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage.

Heating systems that kick on regularly may be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
