<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big merchant who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that consistently monitors energy usage and temperature levels in stores to save money on expenses (especially in the evening) and to alert store supervisors if temperature levels in the stores vary outside of an appropriate range that might avoid customers from shopping at the store.<p>
