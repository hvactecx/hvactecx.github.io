<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally triggered by the absence of appropriate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the workplace indoor air examinations it has conducted. Investigations conducted in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the same to be real. These investigations revealed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in maintaining excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing problems, winter can worsen problems.
