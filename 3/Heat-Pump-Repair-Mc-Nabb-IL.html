<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in home construction is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofing systems. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and dilutes indoor impurities tire them from the house.<p>
