<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large retailer who asked not to be named since he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that regularly keeps track of energy intake and temperatures in shops to save money on costs (especially at night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperatures in the stores vary outside of an acceptable variety that could avoid customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Numerous AC systems come with a number of special features that can further improve performance and effectiveness. For example, property owners might wish to search for one that includes an integrated filter light that will inform you when the air filter needs to be changed.
