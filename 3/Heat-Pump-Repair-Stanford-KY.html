<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Stanford KY - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the job based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones got. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up assessment outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
