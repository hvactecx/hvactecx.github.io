<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
