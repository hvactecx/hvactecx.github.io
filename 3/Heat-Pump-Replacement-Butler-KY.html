<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
