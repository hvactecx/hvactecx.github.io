Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, due to the fact that the absence of moving parts makes them less susceptible to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating system is more reputable than options, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar energy relies on routine sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and dependable  source of energy.<p>
