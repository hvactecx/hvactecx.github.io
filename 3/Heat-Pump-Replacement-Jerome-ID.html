<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (including carbon monoxide gas, radon, unstable natural substances ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can cause negative health conditions.

<p>Sean was very valuable. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>

<p>I typically don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
