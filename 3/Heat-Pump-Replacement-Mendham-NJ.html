<p>These guys have actually been great. At a realtor, I in some cases require contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what work on a home might cost. Recently I needed to call on these men twice. They came out quickly and gave me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a company design they take seriously. You guys are formally on speed dial. Talk with you soon.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work till you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
