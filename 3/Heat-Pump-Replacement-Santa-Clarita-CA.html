<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing product acquired with your home. This company presented a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the evaluation on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health danger factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a new home owner I have actually learned how to recognize the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
