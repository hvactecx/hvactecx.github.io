<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years ago and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
