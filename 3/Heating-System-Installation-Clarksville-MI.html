<h3>Heat Pump Air Conditioner in Clarksville Michigan</h3>
<p>Many people ignore the extent of the indoor air pollution problem. Air contamination is usually imagined as the black smoke produced from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, cleaners, pesticides, and paints utilized in the home. To compound the problem, it is approximated that the typical American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time inside your home, and majority that time is invested in the home.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might grovel twice the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up just a few years ago.<p>
<p>EPA's Overall Direct exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) studies found levels of about a dozen typical natural pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outside, regardless of whether the homes were found in rural or highly commercial areas. Additional TEAM research studies show that while people are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high pollutant levels, and raised concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is finished.<p>
