<p>The purpose of many building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing safety at affordable energy expenses. Load determining is described as the Handbook J calculation and ought to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone. Similar to determining the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the right size of unit for your home also depends on the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
