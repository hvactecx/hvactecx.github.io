<p>Given that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they make more effective. This was originally driven by increasing energy costs, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues.

Evaluation of this data may identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data might not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
