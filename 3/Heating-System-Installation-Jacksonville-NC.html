<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
