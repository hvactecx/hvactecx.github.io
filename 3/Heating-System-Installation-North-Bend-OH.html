<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
