<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
