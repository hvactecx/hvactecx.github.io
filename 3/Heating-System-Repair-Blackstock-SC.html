<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
