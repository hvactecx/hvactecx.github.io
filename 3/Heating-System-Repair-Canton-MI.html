<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Problems in Canton MI</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
