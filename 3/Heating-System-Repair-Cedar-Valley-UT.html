<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
