<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power ought to not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%.

Simply put, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not basic, given that it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
