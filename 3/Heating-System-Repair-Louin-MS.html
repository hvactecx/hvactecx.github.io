All the moist hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then gotten rid of from the space that is being cooled. You'll have a water leak if your HVAC system is not draining correctly. A constraint in your drainage pipes causes a water leak. There are many different locations a blockage can occur. One of the main locations where clogs start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
