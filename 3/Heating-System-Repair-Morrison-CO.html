<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, given that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
