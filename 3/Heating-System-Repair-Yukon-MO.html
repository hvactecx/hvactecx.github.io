However, it is incorrect to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, considering that the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside unit.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
