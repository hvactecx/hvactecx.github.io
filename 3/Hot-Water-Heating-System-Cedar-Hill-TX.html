A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure.
