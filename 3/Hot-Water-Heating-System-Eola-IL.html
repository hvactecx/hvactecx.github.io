<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a referral in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight.

If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic.
