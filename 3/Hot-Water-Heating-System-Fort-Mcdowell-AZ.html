<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Fort Mcdowell AZ?</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
