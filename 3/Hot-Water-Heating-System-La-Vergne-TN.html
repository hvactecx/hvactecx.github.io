Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
