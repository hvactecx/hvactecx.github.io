<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
