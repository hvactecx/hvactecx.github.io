Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists used different approaches. The CMHC study called on several duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they belonged to a study, and the researchers did not manage for time spent or methods used. The EPA research study prescribed and managed techniques used on a smaller sized variety of homes.
