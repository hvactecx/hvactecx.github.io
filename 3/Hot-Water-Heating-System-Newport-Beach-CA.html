Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
