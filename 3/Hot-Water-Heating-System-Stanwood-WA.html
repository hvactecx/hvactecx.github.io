<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
