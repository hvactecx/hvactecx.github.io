<p>Trane central air conditioning conditioners are known for upholding service warranties and offers a standard 10-year service warranty that covers both parts and labor. A Trane XR14 that has a 14 SEER score in energy effectiveness would cost anywhere from $4,800 to $6,800 to install. Trane items are typically more expensive than other HVAC brands, but as the old stating goes, You get what you pay for." Trane is considered a premium brand name that uses exceptional air conditioners, heat pumps, and gas furnaces.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as essential when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
