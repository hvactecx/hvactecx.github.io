<p>We take a look at clues prior to we provide guidance to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
