Ventilation, a common technique of lowering direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will minimize but not get rid of direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.

In addition, the big increases in ventilation it requires to significantly decrease exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can likewise increase energy costs significantly. Subsequently, the most effective way to minimize direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to eliminate smoking there.<p>
