<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
