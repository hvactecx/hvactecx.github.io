<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Good AC Repair Company in Millbrae CA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c unit before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
