<p>A specific a/c unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the very same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is actually heated, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
