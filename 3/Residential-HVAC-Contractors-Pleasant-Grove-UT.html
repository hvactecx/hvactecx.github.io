<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals used in the building or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also develop particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
