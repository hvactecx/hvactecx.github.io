<p>The first ac system and refrigerators used harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
