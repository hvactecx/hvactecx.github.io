<h3>How to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at Wadmalaw Island SC</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
