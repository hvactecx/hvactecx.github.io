<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
