<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is incorrectly eliminated from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can also arise from lead dust from outside sources, including polluted soil tracked inside, and use of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works however the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
