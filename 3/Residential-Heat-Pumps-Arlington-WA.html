<p>Whatever heater you set up, it's important that it's sized properly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should.

<p>Furthermore, property owners have a variety of options to choose from in powering a floor heating unit. Radiant systems work with electrical, gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources.

If the marketplace for that energy source turns volatile, rates can change, costs increase and you can wind up paying more to heat your home despite how low you set your thermostat.<p>
