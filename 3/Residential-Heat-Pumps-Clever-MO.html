<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds).

When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to offer enough changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
