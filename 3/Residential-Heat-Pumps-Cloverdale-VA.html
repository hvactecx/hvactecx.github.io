<p>In-floor heating unit can feature particular health benefits. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you simply can't appear to heat up and discover you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not prone to this issue due to the fact that they heat surface areas and not the air itself. Furthermore, since they do not rely upon fans, ducts, returns and registers to distribute hot air, in-floor heating unit can lower the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your home.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
