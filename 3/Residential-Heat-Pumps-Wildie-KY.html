<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
