<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is created for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of building products, smoking, family items, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in made items. For example, it is utilized to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a part of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finishing items.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the standard water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the pipes. Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>
