<h3>Home Furnace in Highwood IL</h3>
<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're shut down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
