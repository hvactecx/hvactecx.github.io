<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils.

It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
