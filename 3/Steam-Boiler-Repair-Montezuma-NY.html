<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Montezuma NY</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
