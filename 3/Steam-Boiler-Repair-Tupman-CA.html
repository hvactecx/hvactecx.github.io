<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and harden-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>As pointed out above, triggering your brand-new under tile flooring heating unit prematurely, before the mortar has actually treated, can trigger the grout to split or to not adhere properly, and might void the warranty of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile cracked when the system was run before the compound had actually cured. If you do not follow their directions, and mortar producers might refuse service warranty protection.<p>
