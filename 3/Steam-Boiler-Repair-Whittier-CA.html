<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Whittier CA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in home building and construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, roofing systems, and floors. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
