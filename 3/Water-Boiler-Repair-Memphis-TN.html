<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable higher airflow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and new air filtration technologies are becoming more common as offered services in commercial and residential HVAC item packages.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures via mechanical and natural ventilation.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence residents. Unlike other kinds of a/c unit, evaporative coolers rely on the outdoors air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the within a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be allowed to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to keep and comprehend.<p>
