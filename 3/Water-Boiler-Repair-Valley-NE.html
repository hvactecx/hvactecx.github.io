<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC professionals like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that come with owning a high-demand, seasonal organisation. A thoroughly crafted organisation plan for an HVAC company is the first step to handle those lulls and peaks so your profits remain healthy year-round. If you didn't produce a cooling and heating business plan when you began your service, it's not far too late to build one now, or to offer your original strategy an upgrade.<p>

<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists used different approaches. The CMHC research study called on numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they became part of a study, and the scientists did not control for time spent or methods used. The EPA research study recommended and managed techniques utilized on a smaller sized variety of homes. While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have flaws, no other research has challenged the findings. And although the equipment and methods used by duct-cleaning companies have actually changed because these studies were performed, the air ducts in homes have not.<p>

<p>The majority of well and city water does not usually contain lead. Water typically gets lead inside the home from family pipes that is made with lead products. The only method to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water checked. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
